0|I highly doubt this mostly ignored, surely unsuccessful and small bananas effort is going to change minds that have been made up by 100 years of grievous voting obstruction, especially with the current big news of the supreme Court striking down all the various racist partisan voter restrictions around the country.
0|Holy shit they are dropping an Halloween surprise.
0|Chafetz is a known liar (see PP vids) why does he get a pass?
0|Kansas Number 1 in imaginary Muslim terrorists and number 1 in real Nazi terrorists
1|"wow it is totally unreasonable to assume that the agency that covered up Bush war crimes because ""muh republican party"" would be partisan as fuck"
1|Ho ho ho... But Melania said that there is no way it could have happened because she didn't know the woman!

1|I can't wait until @potus starts a twitter war against Morning Joe.
0|Uh, HRC *did* toast Trump in the debates.
0|Upvoters didnt show up in swing threads.
0|So we be better than them.
0|Brace yourself.
0|"To be fair, Trump is having the exact same issue with ""values voters"" and traditional republicans so it may end up being a wash come November"
0|There is no place in our society for this.
0|How do you know he's white?
1|yeah, like the president is a big deal!
0|Chris Christie is just upset that Donald didn't even buy him breakfast the next morning.
0|aw, CNBCs got jokes
0|But we elected a billionaire, and he was gonna stop all the billionaires from... We're fucking morons, aren't we?
0|To be fair, a President making business deals from the Oval Office wouldn't be fair to the American people.
0|Hahaha, no worries :)
0|Dish sponges, latex gloves, and lube
0|Tbh you are right, Israel is so Western that I forgot it was also in the same area!
0|Investigation and house cleaning
0|Well I don't disagree, but what does Ben Carson matter to that?
0|Certainly not as honorable as Lewandowski and Manfarts.
0|I'd say wise diplomacy includes when to wield the stick as well as the olive branch.
0|Trump has always been a self parody going back to the mid 80s when he realized he was a failure at business but liked the attention.
0|He could have a dead hooker in his penthouse and he wouldn't resign.
0|"Breitbart and The Daily Caller are the ""major networks"" to The_Donald."
0|It is only mental illness if they don't literally support and admire what these people are doing...which they do.
0|Usually an ass turkey too
0|Shhh dont interrupt his faux self righteous circle jerk
1|Yes, because putting an old women in jail will fix our problems.
0|He was setting out bait for Trump, who ate it right up.
0|Damn, I could have sworn this Washington Post article says he won.
0|That sounds like a difference without a distinction to me.
0|*applause*
0|Is this another article complaining that Barack Obama didn't literally fix every problem?
1|She should just get out of the way so the spoiled, corrupt, tax-dodging, draft-dodging, groping, lying, alleged child rapist can be president.
0|I don't think it works that way.
0|Comey used his Office to tilt the vote to Republicans.
0|Their hundred trillion dollar bills are fun novelty gifts to a lot of people, though.
0|Up until now I would have thought so but now I'm beginning to think it's getting more stupid faster than it's getting more liberal.
0|And at least one person willing to show up there with an AR-15 and fire it in the restaurant.
0|Well it is the water, but it's also the shady-ass corruption.
0|That's because Democrats actually want to help the country.
0|He said he was open to the VP spot on either ticket.
0|Including at the expense of profit.
0|It's more like a public or private sales pitch.
0|Not talking about it won't make people want to change the EC.
0|Again...You missed the part where democrats killed public option without any help from republicans.
0|These emails all originated from Capricia Penavic Marshall's account and were released on DCLeaks.
0|I think that is the case for like 10 states only.
0|Assange hasnt done anything for anyone to pardon him for.
1|That's how he's bringing jobs back to America!
0|I don't know about many, but there are certainly a handful.
0|Sorta like how she made the speech in Reno on Trump supporters and her support cratered?
0|It's private property.
0|I dare you to willfully feed a Muslim - and not give him/her the bill.
0|bigly, badly
0|Cold war is over guys, we can calm down on this arbitrary red-scare shit.
1|Cringelord... ooh, you got him!
0|Even a broken clockwork elf is right twice a lizard man day or something.
0|"Trump is so lucky his supporters have ZERO critical thinking ability (it's almost impossible to ""rig"" an election if you think it through)."
1|Evolution didn't do it, God did
0|She's not a Senator.
1|She enjoyed it!
1|I'm sure she doesn't have any influence
0|says the codpiece
1|Yeah, how dare she stick up for herself.
1|At least it wasn't abortion
0|We try hard with stick and fire
0|Geez, thanks for making me spit out my coffee...
0|This one is so much better it leveled up
1|Oh please, they are a complete nothingburrito!
0|Because...
1|It's a metaphorical *physical* wall
0|So what's next Colin?
0|"Because the idea that America is a ""white country"" is bullshit."
0|You do know that Bill Clinton was acquitted of the impeachment charges, right?
0|Rumor is that Cruz is going to very soon.
0|alrighty then....
0|He probably golfed like the 2nd late NK dictator
0|Yeah when this all shakes out I hope we never forget Jason Chaffetz unendorsing then re-endorsing Trump and Cruz telling everyone to vote their conscience and then phone banking for Trump
0|"AHahhahahaha don't worry we'll still foot your welfare while you remain unemployed ""because of what a horrible and dangerous precedent this sets""."
1|Innate bias doesn't exist on reddit.
0|This is old.
0|"""Its close cuz its rigged"""
0|If anyone believes this, we don't deserve any of our technology
0|Nope, he should sit down and shut the fuck up.
1|Yea, but MAGA so who cares!
1|Damn it, now he has to make a new name.
0|Difference is she hasn't been on the campaign trail for a while now.
0|Ah.. most cities seem to.
0|We don't discuss that blasphemy.
1|That'll definitely get 'em on your side!
0|"What's the point of fighting ""the establishment"" when the alternative is worse?"
0|Lets not forget that a lot of money on the republican side went down ticket because of skin deep support for Trump at the RNC, traditional republican donors etc.
0|We'll see how much they're cheering after he guts entitlements and their insurance is dropped because of pre-existing conditions.
0|Not necessarily, but that's unrelated to my point.
0|Donald Trump has the best corruption.
0|I think they were pointing out the obvious and inevitable spin from Trump supporters, not actually endorsing that position.
0|Well if the ChangeTip bot weren't blocked here...
0|You're not letting us maintain a message of false equivalency, you must be stopped.
1|well if you aren't rich and white, it's obviously your fault and you're lazy.
0|It also depends on how responsible you believe she is for the war itself, when all she did was vote to allow military force as a last resort based on bad information while representing a state that overwhelmingly wanted her to vote that way.
0|How is he worse than a woman that is absolutely drowning in a sea of scandals, and currently has 2 FBI investigations against her?
0|"""potential"" conflict of interests"
0|"If by ""work"" you mean get us into a perpetual war with Russia designed to make the military industrial complex rich beyond imagination then yes... it will work."
0|And a sexist animal abuser, don't forget that.
1|Yeah, that's the policy every is up in arms about
1|Knowledge is so boring, right!
0|I say deport them
0|Yeah, I know very little about Tim Kaine's politics but what I do know about Pence and his thoughts on where the 'correct' separation of church and state lay very much worry me.
0|Gonna sue all those parents at Sandy Hook elementary to prove it was a false flag operation to get yer guns?
0|Or he'll spend the entire following week ranting about it.
0|And they all have AWPs
0|Now it is starting to make sense why a well respected strategist could throw herself onto the Trump train, despite all his craziness and racism...
1|'People of Colored People' just doesn't have the same ring to it.
0|Yeah that was my bad on the child part, but the Boomers retiring is huge.
0|They just call it Olivia Benson.
0|Yeah, this is a bullshit article, so at least they have that in common.
0|Can't tell if satire or serious.
0|they did stuff at night too.
0|Or starvation, when they realize global warming and/or nuclear winter has made it impossible for crops to grow in the Midwest.
0|Yeah, how dare he use things like 'facts' and 'questions' and 'holding political candidates to actual standards'!
0|Trump said well before 911 that he wouldnt tweet that day, because 911 and respect and whatnot.
1|It is pretty racist to want people to prove who they are tbh.
0|Very, very well said.
0|He hasn't been for a while now.
0|"Wouldn't it be ironic if people voted against Hillary to avoid a so called ""WW3"" with Russia, but ended up with Trump who causes a second civil war?"
0|She was a hateful woman who held back progress
0|But, but, but, trump says he likes real Estate and not things you can't touch
0|to be fair that is true to libertarian idealism, which is partially flawed due to the prisoner's dilemma
0|I dont think you understand what a margin of error is or what it shows...
0|But law and order amiright?
1|stop comparing everything to watergate
0|Because downvoting doesn't remove things from your page unless a bunch of other people do too
0|Yea, we already do fight or help others fight ISIS and all its affiliates throughout the world.
0|Lol...All the Dems denouncing her must be anti-women, *right*?
0|Waaaaah.
0|except china its been the longest lasting empire and will exist till the end of humanity lol
1|Yeah, because his Native American family will do so much better with Trump as President.
0|Keep political ads in their respective candidate subs, this belongs nowhere near here.
0|If only Trump knew that you can get useful information in intelligence briefings.
0|What are you even talking about?
0|Trump obviously understands the way a youth mind works.
0|No betray No betray You betray!
0|Daily Fail going full tabloid on this one.
1|You forget that redditers are rational patient understandable people.
1|That's debatable
0|I'm clearly being facetious, but there's some truth to the levity.
1|Because the elections are rigged
0|So although he wasn't doing anything illegal in any way, you turds are butthurt and are going to spin this as much as you can?
0|Huh, I got in trouble in the 90's for not standing for the pledge.
0|Interesting points, but the risks of spurious rape claims I think are low enough that it is not in anyway justifiable to make victims of rape carry the baby.
1|Had to check post history to see if
0|You're right, there's been plenty of Trump supporters and KKK fanatics protesting and shit.
0|Gulag-worthy.
0|Eh, he did okay compared to his previous performances but he certainly was not up to the standard of any other usual candidate.
0|So the source is your head?
0|It felt dirty submitting it but I couldn't help myself.
1|You dropped this
0|His PR and personal branding needs some serious work
0|all proceeds go to the trump campaign!
1|And to think I just saw on the_donald a tweet of a graph that showed Trump winning the Hispanic vote.
0|At this point, I'm not entirely sure they're not trolling Donald instead of the rest of us.
0|Vermont is literally the easiest population to please in the entire United States.
1|Comey, not credible.
0|It's a cop-out that scientific evidence should be a precursor to using things as medicine?
0|The GrOPe are getting what they deserve.
0|Says who?
0|Then you factor in sub 20% turnout for Hispanic 18-29 year olds.
0|Who wouldn't be concerned about it-kind if frightening!
1|Not a nasty woman.
0|I think we all need to take a step back and watch 'The Manchurian Candidate' again.
0|Water
1|Maybe she had the dirt on Clinton
0|I love her, but the trifecta of republican rage would be to elect a black man (twice), a woman, and then an actual Muslim (sorry birthers) American... Idk who but it would be beautiful to watch them struggle with that
0|And as per agreed from Obama's first run, Hillary would drop, support Barack and her turn would be next.
0|Also a catastrophe for every three disasters.
0|Don't forget their two pronged setup for the eventual banning of public dissent- - all criticism of Trump is liberal media - protesters are paid/all violent
0|Fearection
0|Oh, they have all right....
1|Wow he's really draining that swamp huh?
1|Maybe a CTR shill?
1|Some of the top comments are anti-Clinton, but don't stop a guy from letting his narrative inform his perception of reality.
0|What the fuck are you doing to the world 2016?
0|Iran Contra, turned up the drug war to 11, trickle down economics, and some argue that he only won in 1980 because they did a back room deal with Iran to hold off releasing the hostages until after the election (they were released the day Reagan was inaugurated...) He's the Anti-Christ.
0|Still better then my no healthcare I had before.
0|Actually.. this is a great argument why after 2016 he's done... He can't run in 2020 saying that he's still being audited for 2016 tax returns.
0|That would require evidence.
0|Oh god... I hope someone asks him about the Khans in the next debate.
0|I doubt it, think you have to take the vote literally as one for Pence for president.
1|Brace yourselves, civil war is coming and the Bundy family will be generals in it.
0|Lucky for him schoolhouse rock is on YouTube.
0|paging u/AWildSketchAppeared
0|Now you're talkin'!
1|Says who?
0|I agreed with you that people who base their vote on what a celebrity (Trump) thinks, probably shouldn't be voting.
1|thank you NY for giving us Trump
0|I just made the mistake of googling Lisa Anne at work.
0|I was just pointing out people do say things that they intend to be only for the person they talk with.. I mean if you ask people about their secrets and stuff they did or said you would be surprised
0|You summed it up perfectly.
1|Even if they pass the grandparent rule?
0|I think I heard (anecdotally) that early-voting in Georgia was off the charts, so it may be that a great many voters have already been to the polls days before.
0|And the judge denied their request, so there is that.
1|Police are known to hate Trump
1|Rush was probably trying to polish GW's image.
1|Trump supporters are just sooo smart!
0|Indeed... who suggested that, again?
0|the point is just because something might of been worse doesn't make the current situation excusable.
0|We all know if trump opened a trump grill there would be plenty of customers
0|He never wrote and voted for the laws that embody Corporate America, He merely used the system she and her ilk created.
0|Broken system confirmed.
0|Even if he tried the missile operators would refuse the order.
0|Obama is a Republican shill and should resign.
1|Oh I'm sure it's just the Donald brigading, that's why everybody is more civil than usual.
0|beat me to it, by 9 hours.
1|Yeah that black man they ran last time really didn't go well for them
0|You confuse allegations with facts
0|That is what you are obviously hoping will happen
0|Then they wonder why Wikileaks is so popular
0|You could argue that democracy loses every time the candidate with the most votes does not win the election.
0|praise KEK!
0|As a Red Dwarf fan I would say you're insulting Arnold Rimmer.
0|And how did that work out?
1|I dunno...if you ask my grandpa, Obama is the racist in chief and the real reason for the uptick in racial tensions
0|Your check not cash?
0|Whites did elect Trump.
0|Remember folks -- he's never said who was in the mirror behind him.
0|I love how the best thing clinton drones have on trump right now are these fringe out of context articles
0|Retaliatory tariffs would spark a trade war that would plunge the world back into a global depression.
0|He also did away with the Fairness Doctrine, which paved the way for Fox News propaganda machine.
0|"lol you must be thinking of thinking of Obama sweetheart and it's starting to look like his ""win"" was actually more of an assist by Russian hackers."
0|Let's see if the RNC can out-loser the DNCs senate performance this year, will be a tough feat.
0|Ken Bone... this was your true calling
1|Billions of dollars worth of free ad time for Trump Ignoring Sanders Fucking media What happened?
1|Well that would obviously be because Obama made America so terrible in his 8 years that Donald would need 8 to right the ship.
1|Yeah... The rising median wage at a time when the entire world's developed countries are seeing thay shrink is really hurting the working class...
0|Of course, love killing kids, where've you been?
1|Party of fiscal responsibility.
0|How is this allowed?
0|It's as good-spirited and uniting as Trump's campaign was.
1|That was locker room talk!
0|what does that quote even mean?
1|I mean, when a carpenter fucks up my deck, I find the best guy to fix it is someone who isn't familiar with wood, rather than a better carpenter.
0|Just like if you are a female, you automatically support Hillary, because feminism, or girl power, or whatever.
1|(Yes, but at least this one isn't *black*.)
0|I would have voted Bernie if he was the nominee, but I voted for Trump - not to spite Hillary, but because I think he's the better candidate.
0|Honestly the first atheist president is something i want to see... to bad the DNC disagrees with that sentiment.
0|I would gladly take Kasich over Trump.
1|"No no no see it's just ""economic anxiety"" These ""forgotten people"" deserve our sympathy."
1|The best people folks
1|Good thing trump supports even less people being able to afford their healthcare with high deductible plans and HSAs, those works *tremendously* well for the poor
1|The Clinton standard
0|"""Thing I disagree with"" is the reason Trump got elected is a stupid trope."
0|Enough people voted, just not in the right places like Florida and PA.
0|Your username shows how disgusting of a human you are
1|We far-left progressives sent a strong message to those democrats by ensuring the far right took over all 3 branches of government, win!
0|you are dangerously ignorant of the subject if you think that is how it works.
0|Being angry and unkind worked out quite well for Trump...
1|Ten feet higher!
1|you forgot your
0|You can't be serious... Believe it or not, healthcare will still exist after the ACA is repealed.
0|1929 to be precise and then the Great Depression.
0|Stupid and illiterate.
0|IMHO, it would be better to have fewer questions answered truthfully.
0|Trump never had $100 million in the first place.
0|"Been saving that ""I told you so"" for awhile now?"
0|Do agree with Donald's tweet this morning that flag burning should send you to jail or revoke your citizenship?
0|I'm still looking forward to Secretary of State Kid Rock and Secretary of the Interior Chachi
0|Every Trump supporter needs to make sure to vote on the 28th
1|Well since America and the UK are exactly the same, the otherwise crazy article makes a good point!
0|Cognitive dissonance might cause you to think that, I guess.
0|despite the fear-mongering the American markets are surging and the strength of the dollar is at an 11-year High.
1|rigged!
0|pation.
0|None of that included good qualifications to be SecDef
1|Oh yeah, the guy cleaning my toilet for minimum wage is sure stealing the fruits of my labor, I want to kick him out so I can have his job and he's not taking my money anymore.
1|That's not relevant, Trump is the only one who can't do what everyone else in politics does!
0|So we're just gonna forgot Debbie and Donnie helped Hillary cheat?
1|But Obama takes too many golf trips!
0|id like to see them try to be honest
1|Clearly that is what trump does
1|Your right, fuck public servants and their selfish ways.
1|He really is an environmentalist
0|Fair and balanced
0|that is my gut (emotional) reaction to patriotic protests... then my mental reaction often counters my first impression.
0|Something this website is known for.
0|I'm kidding, bigly
1|Well they sure showed those liberals to be wrong!
1|Wow how dare trump not build a concrete wall in unviable locations and instead opt for a fence
0|Who had the best policy?
0|As someone who lives downstream from Three Mile Island this is the real concern.
0|My puppy thanks you.
1|Mission Accomplished!
1|Or if they can't go to another state, Trump suggests that they find a very good, high quality staircase to fall down from.
1|Yeah that totally makes it better
1|Yeah but this is 16 years later, you know 8 years after America collapses and we're all back in the stone age
0|If China doesn't buy our shit then jobs are lost here and prices skyrocket domestically.
0|Different strokes.
1|"""If you die because they don't let you buy insurance then don't shop there next time."""
0|And it showed that he was more unpopular, just like what the votes showed
1|They'll sooner die than accept help from carpetbaggers
0|"And half their comments were ""Trump supporters didn't do this, here's money."""
1|But how does that justify Sanders telling his supporters they should riot in the streets?
1|Because civil disobedience isn't a thing and it would be sooooo much work to convince people to not pay their federal taxes.
0|While I agree they're delusional, I'm not sure him being a Republican is really an argument, considering the reaction a large number of Republicans are having toward Trump.
1|Yes but was he abused and attacked by someone from a position of privilege?
1|Yeah they definitely didn't learn a hard lesson.
1|You forgot your
1|We're gonna be pray'n for ya!
0|If Pence were smart, he'd call upon Trump to step aside, and run for the presidency himself.
0|John Bolton, the Uber Neoconservative, likes Trump

1|Because he is strong for speaking his mind!
1|Um it's a top selling VHS, how it is not considered proof?
0|Edgy, is that from a meme?

1|yeah, increasing GDP growth never helped anybody
0|"Is his message ""I don't want you to know what I am doing""?"
1|My mistake, I forgot voter purges are only a bad thing when it only gets your candidate of choice.
0|It was money we owed them from a decades old arms deal we never delivered on, but to humor you Trump, because he was doing business with them during their nuclear programs development, the release of cash to Iran happened after deal in which they agreed to shut down the program.
1|You could be twitter famous though!
1|"""I know you are, but what am I!?"""
1|"But your opponent is ""Crooked Hillary,"" so why are you the one who is so worried about fact-checking, Don?"
1|Yeah all those national debates and no one asked.....

0|Sorry I don't want to breathe pollution
0|But rich Donnie boy definitely gives a shit about the struggle of everyday people right?
0|I would think that a pretty large contingent of Repubs would love to dump him in favor of President Pence, so yes, they probably would.
0|Good thing Trump hasn't filled his appointments with islamophobes who think we are being too gentle with the middle east
1|Just wait and see, give him a chance!
0|I suggest you take a long hard look at what the US people are okay with.
1|But, but, Trump and the Banana Republicans said they could.
1|Move along people, nothing to see here.
1|Yeah because anyone who authorizes double tap drone strikes is going to draw a moral line at torture
1|Voted the same as Bernie Sanders 93% of the time in the Senate, and adapted a majority of his stances into the parties official platform--literally a Republican.
1|I'm looking forward to the American Battle of Cnidus that will be fucking awesome.

0|The President doesn't get to joke about shit like this; if he still doesn't get that, there's no way anyone could possibly think he's fit for office.
0|So you think because you voted for Trump you will be allowed to speak and you are ok with the President elect demanding an apology from a few people who spoke in dissent?

0|And I look forward to no one reading the damn thing, like last time.
0|On the bright side, it WOULD make it hard to him to stay president, were he to win.

0|I'm sorry for your loss.
1|"""Black isn't even a race!"""
0|Well, considering the timing with Chaffetz, I think there's reason to believe that Republicans in Congress had a hand in making that letter happen, not the other way around.
1|Usually those guys are so good at spotting a fake.
1|That certainly won't radicalize people

0|Reform would involve a Constitutional Amendment, and in the current political climate, the level of cooperation and compromise required for that is all but impossible to attain.
0|I've heard that the reason there are so many Clinton events in PA is because they don't have early voting, so it made sense to go to other states first and backload with PA events just a day or two before the voting starts.
0|So Clinton did her job, despite not wanting to.
1|"""Literally"" Yeah because all of these intelligence agencies are not corrupt &amp; driven by money"

0|Do you have any username regret?
0|So you're going to deny that about a month after Sanders dropped out that content in this subreddit was specifically aimed at slamming Trump and, if nothing else, rationalizing why Clinton is at least better?
0|Working on it.
0|So this libertarian candidate has a tolerance for up to two questions in a series.
0|There's a Clinton joke in here somewhere
0|Didn't an intelligence agency get him elected?

1|As tragic as the McCann case is, it's nowhere near satanic enough for Podesta to be involved.
1|Jokes on us, this is part of the 12D Backgammon operation.
0|Then enjoy President Trump.
1|Wow so convincing!
1|Surely the clinton supporters grew organically directly after the Democratic convention, right?

0|Excuse me while I laugh my fucking ass off at your adorable victim complex
1|Oh yeah that would never happen.
0|Too bad she couldn't win where it mattered and lost counties that had voted democrat for decades.
1|Right ...and it has nothing to do with the mods at all.
1|WRONG.
0|The dude you replied to didn't talk about Obama at all, this post is about NC what are you talking about
0|She definitely failed by not giving attention to the rust belt (like Bill said she should), but it's also hard to run a campaign when your opponents voters were largely waiting quietly in the shadows so the polling was way off
0|Tom Brady says he didn't vote...
1|They keep stopping us from rigging the election and it proves the election is rigged!
1|What some call smart, others call self-dealing, others still fraud, who are we to judge?

1|Are we sure his dad isn't intimidating him though?
0|I don't think you know what a strawman argument is after reading your example.
0|Except a lot of the local newspapers get cut into the old boy's network.
0|Oh good thing they cleared that up - I'm glad they don't have a history of lying about everything as long as it benefits the DNC :) Hope President Trump revokes their White House press privilege.
1|You racist, sexist, misogynist, un-educated, FUCKING WHITE MALE.

1|HAHAHAHAH YEAH THAT'S WHAT THE COUNTRY GETS FOR NOT VOTING BERNIE!
0|Talk about desperate
1|Well, you really sure showed them!
0|Well I'm happy I'm not the only one he sees the comparison.
0|The DNC cheated Bernie and the voters already punished them.
1|Clearly President material.

0|President-Elect Trump thanks you for your efforts that gave him the win.
0|that is called down ballot voting and it is a very real thing in politics all across the world
0|Remember that time he openly lied about previous positions he's had during a national debate?

0|Truly a huge blow for the administration....of snl

0|... because I do NOT want to have to deal with being your Vice President.
1|I am glad your argument is based on fact and logic and not just fear mongering...
0|I agree, but we don't really need a revolution right now.
1|Its so much better for both sides to agree to abolish the rule of law for themselves.

0|This is literally the legion of doom
0|The rock IS more intelligent
0|There's a difference between having a favourite candidate and using your power in the DNC to favour that candidate.
0|And at that speed there is no doubt going to be cases of mistaken identity or wrongfully deported people.
0|Maybe the DNC should push her again in 2020.
0|Trump will be up at 3am, jacking it to Americans through XKEYSCORE.
0|... and considering he won't win.
1|Oh yeah he's REALLY going against the grain and shaking it up
0|Yeah, and with all of the promised RIFs in government facilities, expect the market to be FLOODED with jobless engineers and scientists
0|Christian too!
0|I'd argue that anyone that believes only one of two top candidates are viable for a vote is irrational, on that note I agree.
0|You're also not thinking about Orthodox Jews who cannot vote on a saturday.
0|What I find hilarious is the fact that the big difference between Clinton and Obama in '08 was that he was against a mandate.
1|But Hillary was the corporate shill candidate.
1|But emails.... Clinton is corrupt!
1|No problem, we'll just make sure all 25 Dems get reelected and then elect 8 more to take seats from Republicans!
1|That's not overly dramatic at all...
1|Yeah we really knew everything about Clinton...
1|God damn millenials are all for working from home unless it's trump
1|I'm sure the fossil fuel industry knows the science better than the actual scientists.
1|Government is bad mkay?
1|And it has nothing to do with the outright political obstruction at the federal and state level.
0|I agree with everything you say, but disagree if you're implying Bernie is the man for the job.
1|Yes, but Canada is our ally.
0|But emails.
0|It worked for Apple.
0|Kind of a low bar, but this is the world we live in now.
1|Maybe corporate fuckery would move the timetable up for the Yellowstone super volcano to go off, and take care of the Midwest!
1|Yeah, and the people that fail the test can still count for 3/5 of a vote!
1|This looks credible
1|98.4% chance Hillary wins the remaining uncounted ballots.

1|Insults like that elected Trump!
1|This attitude is why Trump got elected.
0|let the downvotes rain
1|I don't suppose it's still early enough to pass an emergency law abolishing the electoral college and letting us use pure popular vote for elections?
0|that's not at all fair, don't blame us when she doesn't even try to win us over.
0|Look at how hack-able election machines have shown to be- running undisclosed software on proprietary machines, producing unencrypted text files for which there are no chains of custody... If someone didn't want elections to be hack-able, no one would allow such klugy and insecure systems to be put in place.
0|Yeah, ther should provide the names of the intelligence agents, and admit the means that were used to collect this data, so that naysayers online can be satisfied.
0|"His massive conflicts of interest The fact that he's STILL never released his tax returns The ""blind trust"" he's set up for his businesses while in office, meanwhile 3 of the people charged with running those businesses blindly are all serving on his transition team I could go on..."
1|Giving massive coastal cities complete dominion over the electoral process is *true* enfranchisement!

1|You forgot the

1|Good to see they learned the lesson of that dark time in American history.
0|Seems like the right amount of sensitivity.
0|Knowing the GOP, they will probably take out something that benefits gays or transgender and call it Trumpcare.
0|What do you expect of a group that selectively interprets what parts of the Constitution they like then goes out on bold face lies like they respect it all?
0|I don't even like TYT and yet I'd argue that she is right, its still better than mainstream media.

0|Maybe if someone like Omar Mateen were added to the list for travelling to Saudi Arabia in 2012, the FBI could look at the list and see him there instead of blowing off the tip they got before the second largest terrorist attack on US soil.
1|You're right, everyone should stop protesting
1|if only there was a designer in the trump family who could pick up the slack.
1|and didn't you know, their healthcare system is better than america's.

1|Terrorists have no rights, esp not the 1st!
0|Not to downplay how scary this administration is, but America has been a kleptocracy backed by racism from the start.
0|"Finally, a practical use for the ""I voted"" sticker!"
1|Yea and it has nothing to do with homophobia
1|Shit i forgot the
0|What do cops have to do with it and how does that excuse Obama's abuse of power in your mind?

1|that makes him smart
1|Yeah how dare he deport spies... What an asshole.
0|"your country has been caught in ""active espionage"" too.. so its nothing new to be dealing with leaders of a country who engage in ""active espionage"""
1|and salaries are climbing!
0|It's a one way street...whichever way I go...
0|But what about the 1st amendment?
1|Why are you so racist?
1|Benevolent sexism is still sexism, you bastard!
1|"But it's ""Racial Realism"""
0|Uh..... I'll get back to you on that.
0|Yeah, there's no real good option this cycle, even including the two third-party candidates.
1|That's such a really big jump.
1|Is that where you write underwater ?
1|So that pastor just made Trump his bitch?
0|Well, they don't have any legitimate policy ideas, so what else are they supposed to talk about?
0|Oh, hey you must be Canadian too.
1|They sure did a good job of predicting the Brexit
0|His party got taken over by crazy people, and the party establishment tucked tail and kowtowed.
0|Or, ya know, they heard a presidential candidate bragging about sexually harassing a married woman.
1|Lots and lots of rallies
1|Bold military action is just the thing Americans are calling for.
1|This is political correctness run amok.
0|Makes perfect sense.
0|No, but you just did.
0|So you rather have the borderline facist elected?
1|Yea comey is a clinton plant!
1|But Russia!
0|Remind me, what's the half-life on coal?
0|This would actually be a decent election if it were Pence vs Kaine and their respective VP picks
1|I know, McAfee would have been sooo much better
1|She obviously was clearly wearing braces.
0|I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a man who thinks EVE Online is run by the CIA...
0|They are to Trump
0|"Apparently, he called West Virginians ugly because they don't ""know what make-up is."""
1|What else was he supposed to do, show sympathy and appear weak like Obama?
1|I hope that is
1|If Mylan company wants to dodge this bullet, they only need to replace their Democratic connected CEO with a Republican connected CEO.
1|Oh the poor pitiful things.
1|I don't think Hillary was the one saying Mexicans are sending their rapists, but yeah - democrats are the ones using racial fear mongering.
0|What a difference a one minute video can make.
0|He might of up his support enough already to flip it.
0|He somehow avoided Rosie O'Donnell.
0|"""A broken clock is right twice a day""."
0|The substance of an unmoderated debate with Trump would be about the same as that of a cheeto puff.
1|You forgot
1|Well I hope Hillary and all her supporters get anal fissures after Harambe rapes them
1|Yeah, but she didn't tell everyone she had pneumonia so she's a liar.
0|The simple fact that the media was 100% on board pepe=nazi across multiple networks should get everyone to agree that the media is biased as hell and has no real journalism to follow.
1|Racists
0|Wang is the man.
1|Yes, because the only way to deal with things you want to change is to run away from them.
1|Yeah, he's an Uncle Tom
1|shhh everyone knows those polls showing Trump supporters are hateful morons were faked by the lamestream media
0|Which is false and incredibly insulting and offensive.
1|it wasn't an accident or the MSM would have edited his comment Hillary has the vapors.
1|No, it's because jail should be meant for serious offenders, like marijuana possession charges or unpaid parking tickets.
0|Because I'm easy come
0|This is before the subpoena was filed.
1|Russians do.
0|Shift.
0|yeah, i know, the internet is a blessing and a curse.
1|Yeah but then we're technically right.
1|They don't cover Russian propaganda
1|But we don't need glass steagle, right?
1|But it wasn't her!
1|Being tired is definitely a symptom of impending death.
0|Care to show some proof?
1|oh jeeze this is as shocking as it will be when trump beats hillary.
1|Might as well be though
0|I guess it's a good thing you aren't running for president then?
0|It's true.
1|Mainly because they come out of your mouth?
1|Yes, because he had such a cooperative Congress and nothing else to address over the past eight years ...
0|"Ah, the very scientific metric of ""I've seen plenty of people."""
0|The Emmy's are rigged
1|Shame he didn't run for president or something.
1|One responsible enough to safeguard information of the highest magnitude evidently.
1|Lol wealth inequality = great depression
0|This was at 30% within 2 minutes of posting with no comments -_-
0|"""We don't agree on almost any issue, but vote for me anyways!"""
1|Only bc they believe in her vision for America though
1|Well that's just ridiculous.
1|Most transparent candidate in history!
1|Ah, the polls have gone from trustworthy back to skewed in favor of Clinton I see
1|My buddy didn't die facedown in the mud for...
1|What the hell do they have to lose, after all?
0|Has he appeared before this committee already?
1|I really hope you forgot your

1|being born in Scotland with a name like Donald Trump?
0|You should aspire to have the morals of a 7th grader than.
0|Maybe they are excited for the idea of Armageddon?
1|Yeah let's stick with The Clinton strategy : sending thousands of innocent poor Americans to lay down their lives to intervene in a war where both sides hate us and we're just trying to 'help'
1|I think this dropped off your comment
0|Takes longer for west coast people to absorb it so they replay it and add commercial breaks for you.
1|Yeah, but we need to elect Trump to send these people a message.
0|Oh, you are serious.
1|Because that's not irrational at all.
0|I wish I had stacks like that.
1|While they are at it, they might give themselves term limits.
1|So sexist!
1|...but other than all that, the lying, the lack of knowledge on foreign and domestic affairs, or the lack of basic understanding on what the government actually does...why shouldnt he be president?
1|Hey, he only *enabled* the war criminals!
0|Careful, you might get a job on a late night talk show with all that wit.
1|Well clearly this has no potential for abuse at all, and won't create a headache for government workers trying to weed out the garbage requests from the good ones.
1|By not privatizing it, duh.
1|Well the truckers should all go back to school and find new careers
0|...huh?
0|And enters another giant douche and turd sandwich
1|I'm sorry my pleb dictionary was not worthy of your high birth.
0|Damn and he always has a happy face on
1|I never cease to be amazed at the number of lawyers in this sub
0|not sure who you think is my man, but what are you referring to?
0|"Google ""Hillary Australia"" It is the first fucking link"
1|You're right, the GOP is completely and utterly racist and has no other ideals.
0|And Clinton *is* actually a Christian - which in my mind is a negative
1|This just shows Trump is smart.
0|I'm writing in Bernie Sanders, fuck it...he's still the only one even remotely involved with the presidential election with at least half a brain and/or an ounce of ethics.
1|I'm sure that was just her covering up another mini-stroke.
1|He's only dead because Rafael Cruz killed him.
0|Most of the Clinton attack ads are just clips of Trump talking.
1|Because she was so scared.
1|It's not fraud if it is a white, god fearing republican, committing it.
1|They should be grateful that we drove them from their lands and locked them into generations of poverty.
0|Don't forget making fun of a handicapped person
0|Lol
1|This is going to end well for him.
0|That would not make it Hillary's fault, though.
0|TIL first-ladies' have the authority to pardon people.
0|This man will not accept his defeat, and I'm not sure just how far he will take his followers to defend him from a Clinton win the day after.
1|Nothing, but it doesn't matter because Hillary.
0|Haha
1|Bet the pope would be cool with his cheating statement.
0|That's a birthday present from a woman who has almost 1.8 billion YouTube music video views for just one song.
0|It makes exactly as much sense as being able to fire someone for smoking weed on their days off.
1|Which is why book learnin that isn't the bible is clearly a sin.
0|I can't stand when either side uses this logic cuz it literally goes both ways.
1|Yea, we wouldn't want to shy away from our humble foreign policy that exists now.
1|You found me out.
0|"""It was just a possible sexual assault a few years ago the pivot's coming"""
1|Fucking brilliant deflection.
1|Yea..former Director of Homeland Security...for the Bush Administration....clearly a shill who was just waiting for his chance to vote for her.
0|Who is who again?
0|I know, right!
0|"And the money from his ""charity""."
1|That would be the smart thing to do...
1|You can only fact check negative things about the Donald (except they're all biased of course so it doesn't count) and positive things about Hillary because everyone knows how evil that criminal bitch really is so the facts would be false anyways!
1|Well I guess I should apologize to him.
1|Who let the cripple in in the first place?
0|It's something they can identify with...
1|Both parties are the same!
0|Trump is one sheltered, sheltered man.
1|Uh Uh... it's unbiased
0|Nope, that's why I gave it even odds.
1|Yes, because displacing millions of voters(in major cities, which usually vote democrat) in a swing state notorious for messing up elections, is exactly what liberals want to do, a month before an election.
0|no law and order, he's been trying to get more illegal people here, benghazi, he worked with the Clintons to hide emails, he created and continues to arm ISIS, he purposely tries to start a race war, uses his government controlled media to try and convince the nation to elect the worst candidate in history (Hillary) and there's plenty more.
1|Oh, so you are one of the dumb ones?
1|IT JUST MEANS THAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS GETING SCARED.
1|Entertainment?
1|Yes, because claims he can openly sexually assault a woman pale in comparison to Hillary...
1|My favorite Bible passage is when Jesus grabbed Mary by the pussy and told the disciples to check out her sex tape
1|everybody knows that the more a fringe right wing site resembles a limewire-approved computer virus, the more trustworthy it is!
1|I feel so guilty as a white person, I hope Obama saves us by running for a third-term!
1|You forgot the
1|100% of Democratic voters definitely want Hillary to be their presidential nominee.
1|Dan Bilzerian for President 2020.
0|"I don't know what ""Make America Great Again"" means, but it seems to be supporting tax breaks for the rich, grasping to hold on to an outdated idea of the American economy through initiating a trade war, kowtowing to Moscow, abandoning allies as well as the international order that has undoubtedly benefited the US, accelerating climate change, and institutionalizing racism, sexism, homophobia."
0|i like to call it ironitical
1|Terrifying
1|SO you'll claim it's true again in a week...
0|What numbers could he possibly be looking at to draw this conclusion?
1|What about Hillary?
1|Now THIS is theimportant news we need to see
0|Breitbart is news, right?
0|Every Tic Tac is followed by a comically small, orange-hued, hand bursting out and clasping your genitals.
0|No which is why I hope they just go balls out to say neener neener you can't stop us.
0|More importantly, who still uses a musket?
0|I'm a lady who feels the same way about Brienne in Game Of Thrones.
0|I'm an exhibit of how the other side rigged the election, but now it's our turn
1|Wigg?
1|well if we kept the Somali Muslims out we wouldn't have this problem
0|If it's that easy, why exactly has that not been done?
0|No, but 'member Chewbacca?
1|He's 3rd party, so of course he is great.
0|you mean a creeper ?
1|well, he was doing that, too!
1|Cuck's Anonymous.
1|Yeah, gotta give the deplorables a chance to harass and threaten them!
1|Not True Americans!
1|"""Quest to kill more people than Stalin"" I think that's been on her dream board since high school."
1|Can't imagine why.
0|Tell him heads is Johnson and give him a two-headed coin.
0|And how many times did Donald Trump visit idaho?
0|They are the same... Yet the gop seems a lot more obsessed with investigating dems
0|Better yet, keep SoCal and make all the wet parts of California part of Cascadia haha
0|The power to personally profit off of his own taxpayer funded protection?
0|It's cute that you don't realize you've lost too.
0|I really, really hope the DOJ comes down on the GOP for violating their consent decree for not putting this down with vicious ferocity.
0|Once is her husband
0|No
0|If Trump becomes president we will lose a lot of strength.
0|"The amount of times he went ""WRONG"" made him sound like an alarm."
0|Identity politics
1|Proof that climate change IS a Chinese hoax!
0|Correcting Trump's Record.
1|Those sneaky Chinese.
1|Have scientists been able to determine the color of the sky on Trump's planet?
1|I can't explain insanity.
1|85% thought that dogshit would be a better president.
1|That's right we had slaves of all races before that.
1|Back to the principles that made America great, free Indian land and slave labor.
0|"You know when someone starts a statement ""with all due respect,"" it's gonna be good."
0|Well when you are the only politician in the major party ring that doesn't believe that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese, you get like that.
0|"""It's different because Trump'll be **our** authoritarian tyrant!"""
0|Oh man theres so much open mindedness and well though out discussion on both sides of the issue and certianly no circle jerking at all here.
0|Her ads say the nastiest of things.
0|Well color me surprised
0|Lol, so because polling was wrong economists are wrong too?
1|And then costs will come down!
0|Working in a warehouse for horse manure is too risky for her.
0|I believe Trump would lift the American boot off the world's neck - mainly by mistake.
0|I'd enjoy it a lot more if they weren't dragging the rest of us down with them.
0|This whole election is just way over your head.
0|Look at all these trump supporters taking personal responsibility
0|TIL: that conservatives should believe is a nefarious plot that all electronics companies want an office in silicon valley, all fashion companies want offices on garment districts, brokerage firms want to be in New York, shopping companies want to be near ports, and all trucking companies want to be near roads.
0|one would almost think dems are so upset because Hillary did so poorly lol
0|"'two ""bankers boxes"" of printed emails that went missing in the course of the probe'"
0|Seething Sanders supporter here: could have used these leaks during the primary.
0|Says man who doesn't know the history of the south in excluding blacks from juries and prosecutors keeping black people off of juries solely due to their race
0|I can't respect most Trump voters and I don't even like Hillary.
0|He is a good politician and a good politician doesn't know why he or she does anything.
0|"Remember when Republicans said about every issue ""Leave it to the states"" funny how now it is the opposite"
0|Roll the basket to the bunker!
1|I don't see the big deal; lots of people who were born before this election cycle are voting.
0|I always entertained when Al Franken speaks
0|True
0|My god, he REALLY wants Carson on his cabinet, doesn't he?
0|I don't think there is much to like about Trump unless you believe all of his bullshit rhetoric and think that since he is rich he somehow knows how to help the country.
0|Guilty as charged
0|Judging by most comments I've seen from Trump supporters, her comments werent far off target.
0|Yet there is that doctrine of not yelling fire in a crowded theater.
0|Is Russia blackmailing him with the emails they hacked from their servers?
0|Perfect analogy.
0|Not so sure if they've thought through taking basic needs away from poor, angry, well-armed people.
1|Yes, George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum, noted Hillary Supporter...
0|Sure, right after Breitbart, WND, WesternJournalism, FOX all shut down first.
0|David, I did.
0|Quit while you're behind.
1|BREAKING NEWS GUYS!...
1|Woah, no need to generalize about minorities.
0|ha....the long con.
0|After last night, I can definitely see him getting an endorsement from water.
0|He's a sick genius tearing the establishment apart at the joints.
0|Damn democrats.
0|Dude wanted to build an energy wall around the US.
0|Republicans are concerned about the purity of the vote
1|Hey, it's *totally* plausible that third-party presidential candidates could get eighteen percent of the vote nationwide this year!
0|Again, I'd like to see you say that to the face of an actual veteran.
1|The Luddites were right all along!
0|Hilary is so bad that they'll let the man-child appoint the next 2-3 Supreme Court Justices right?
1|More like Microshill am I right?
0|If Christie has any sort of say in the matter, bye bye legalization.
0|Also, 2% is within the margin of error for nearly every poll.
0|How can these ass holes think of themselves as patriots?
0|But when you tell people what you've always seen, you're the far left asshole.
0|Why shouldn't those of us that have been part of the community for a long time.
0|If you live in a solidly Dem or GOP state, go for it, if you live in a swing state it's better to not risk a Trump presidency
0|Count for taking away votes from Hillary
0|Professional Victims
0|You don't say...
1|Scary Democrats more like it
0|We don't know what will be competitive in two years when Republicans will own the state of the nation.
1|, but what about all the Trump ladies WHO SUCCEEDED.
0|*their because you are not smart.
0|You know Clinton may have won women but it was pretty damn close.
0|It feels like we've already have had four years of scandal in this week.
0|Especially Barron because he's going to be Secretary of the Cyber.
0|Don't know about Netscape but FireFox has a private window that should do the same thing.
0|lol, you think he voted before this.
0|They're really giving her a case to push for stricter gun laws when she's elected
0|Make an alt account and subscribe so you can still bathe in the salt after it goes private.
1|Don't worry, he'll get 95% in 2020
0|Well, it's officially time to STOP caring for other peoples' children.
0|Nono, he said I won it if you remove all those that voted democract, its illegal to vote democrat, he will be passing the law soon
0|We could've had the dankest of times, instead we got the darkest of times.
0|How many times is this going to be posted?
0|So like 90% of the articles in the top 50 on this sub
0|If that is the case, I don't see how the GOP gets to take credit for a libertarians legalization position when the libertarian has to forfeit that belief when they cast their vote.
0|The first modern president to get less than half of the vote in both the primary and general wants Goldman Sachs back in the driver seat.
0|Aka family values.
1|"""They're being politically correct like Librul scum!"""
1|B..b...but...  AL GORE
0|Haha that's one of the more legitimate reasons I've heard
1|This obviously proves both candidates equally bad.
1|Fuck capitalism and the MSM, amirite?
1|Yeah, but she's under a gag order and can't talk about it so she doesn't count.
0|Well, he attacked Khizr Khan
0|The most annoying part is that every Trump supporter will still say that there is no need for Trump to release his tax documents.
0|Well in this context, the OP is clearly saying that Bernie was too good for us, but in the Dark Knight, it's saying that Batman wasn't good enough for Gotham, so they're kind of entirely different within the two contexts.
0|And a USS Trump
0|Even then, it's anyone's guess how she'll fare with likeability.
0|link?
0|Thanks babe
0|The fact this shit gets 4200 upvotes... what the fuck
0|Correcting the record I see
1|Right before her Satanic Rituals
0|Probably more voter fraud.
1|Oh man, I wonder if it's because Biff is based on Donald Trump?
1|You can only be racist towards humans, duh.
0|I try not to capitalize his name, but I mostly do the same for hillary
1|Fucking plebs with jobs wanting to vote.
0|So, basically this guy didn't do anything...
0|I can't wait for Trump to say that he was from the Clinton campaign who is trying to kill him or some shit like that.
0|It doesn't, but the participation rate has stabilized and is back on the rise, so this isn't due to drops in the participation rate
0|And there are seven states that do not allow write-ins.
0|This is one of the few times I'm happy the US military has bigger guns.
1|A political ad with misleading information but not technically lying Wow...never saw that before

1|All of them are old white guys, who'd have guessed that?
1|Hey can't you get both sides to vote for you if you say things that each side likes to hear?
0|They've sold the franchise off and brought in new writers and I just hate the direction this last season has taken, it's like bad fanfic with a Reality label slapped on.
0|Apologies, it's really hard to tell these days.
0|If you're so sure about that then you better be hyper vigilant that your congress people don't vote in favor of sending it to her desk.
1|I'm sure Hillary will pardon him now instead of trying to kill him
0|They'd use their phone that has GPS and solid state drives while claiming quantum mechanics and general relativity are baloney.
1|That's one way to win over the millennial vote.
1|And we were doing so great before that!
1|Oh, thanks for setting us straight, federalist.
1|Yeah because the FBI/CIA don't have better things to do than to DDoS the drudge report.
0|I'm still convinced Ted Cruz is Will Forte.
0|"""The time extension was legal, and the polling place was observed by officials from the Clark County Registrar of Voters office"" Nothing to see here, move along."

1|I'm so happy that fascism is in vogue again
0|When was Trump ever in a locker room?
0|Ebola?
0|So you support punishing 300 million US citizens because of the actions of a a few people?
0|This is news?
1|So what your saying is that you think he is being paid to vote a certain way.
0|We should just have one anyway.
0|Who cares?
0|Ted Nugent house parties
0|"I guess the campaign ""no child left without a gun"" is inminent, then."
0|Literally chopping up live babies and putting them in a blender.
0|I mean, also the fault of all the people who voted for Trump, and Trump.
0|the FSM was created by a Kansas science teacher to counteract the 'equal time' provision given to Intelligent Design alongside evolution.
0|7-8 million more Americans voted for Obama 4 years ago.
0|It wouldn't give more people no say, it would give everyone a say, like I said earlier geographically it'd be like giving Italy control over Norway.

0|I'm toying with it, but I want to see how the purges go first.
0|It's crickets because the Russians rolled up most of their propaganda program after they won.
1|That's right because no one ever votes based on policies or issues.
0|..and then blame Obama.
0|For every dollar HRC has contributed to her campaign he has donated ~50 to his.
0|Google, Apple, Uber (self driving cars), Microsoft, Intel, and Disney Research all have pretty substantial offices in pittsburgh..
0|Laminate counters can last 50+ years easily unless you deliberately try to stab or burn it.
1|This is sexist
1|Isn't that covered by Obamacare presently?
0|luckily, going by the title of the article, at least all of the black/asian/latino voters will be alright!
0|Trump can overturn this pretty easily AFAIK.
0|But as long 29% of those people continue to vote Republican, Trump and the Republicans don't care.
1|But the past is the past!
0|Yeah but they will just grandfather in the elderly so they wont be impacted
0|but I dont find it funny
1|But all the wmds we found!
0|"So far we have Kanye, George Clooney, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and now Jay Z. What about the women?"
1|This is the attitude that got Trump elected.
1|Yeah, i'm glad Obama closed Guantanamo Bay
0|You mean like obstructing Obama for 8 years, or maybe shutting down the Government like Cruz did, just because the GOP wasn't getting its way?
1|So glad Hillary used her convention to showcase new talent like Obama had the opportunity in 2004.
0|Why don't you support meaning 1?
0|Most of Hitler's voters didn't vote primarily for the racist policies either, they still got them.
1|Well... I mean, it is obviously Tim Kaine's turn
1|OMG the next president is taking advice from a rapist/murdere racist
1|Blessed be our New Founding Fathers
0|I wonder how different the primaries would have been if she joined him then?
0|Huh, where have we heard that before?
0|That's how brown shirts roll.
0|It must be frustrating that so many of them can't vote.
0|Which is why Donald had the charity paid directly by people that owed him money.
0|It's because he's aging relative to his view on how old the world is: 57 when the world is only 4,000 years old is relatively quite older than 57 for those of us whose great, great, great grandma's didn't ride dinosaurs.
1|What a true hero she is
0|At least she aint a hoe like Milania.
1|You forgot the
1|Who cares, MAGA.
1|"lol that story never happened...Trump supporters would have accepted the results with class and dignity, just like they keep saying these ""paid protesters"" should be doing."
0|Well because almost every president has been an old white man, another old white man voting for an old white man isn't exactly a story, an old woman who was literally born before women could vote getting the chance to vote for a woman is a more remarkable story
0|I almost couldn't believe she said that.
0|Clarence Thomas is doing all he can to expend as little energy as possible by doing as little as possible so he can live as long as possible.
0|Playing 11D 'eat the pizza' game.
0|It's the Alamo all over again!
0|There was no way he could hold it any longer with his tiny hands.
0|Look to Cory Booker in 2020 instead.
0|Evidence?
1|Yeah because American Jews are such a fucking monolith
0|There are more important things.
0|I would also be amused with this.
0|Fact: If you tout and call yourself a democracy it really should.
0|spent it all on paintings of himself, sorry guys.
1|Easy, bing-watch 'West Wing' to get a crash course on how to run the White House
0|"""Crooked Hillary tho!"""
0|And Trump is goddamned awful by that measure.
0|I don't click on InfoWars links any more than salon...Think Egypt :)
1|Oh yeah, we forgot..only conservatives, specifically Donnie supporters have guns No democrat or republican who is against Donnie would ever have a gun.
0|"""higher education not affordable"" ""lol stupid uneducated white trash Trump voters"""
1|"What are ""facts"" anyway?"
0|You mean like the 10 million net jobs created during the Obama Administration?
1|yea thats why Trump won, fake facebook news stories
0|Begone with those slideshows!
0|Along with Bill and Hillary, it'd be fun to watch the right go into full meltdown.
1|I'm sure he will keep his cool and be diplomatic when meting foreign leaders
1|They had a personal opinion and a personal set of facts to back up that opinion.
1|it's certainly very objective to assume that none of the people who are staying home share the same viewpoint as the protesters
1|I never imagined there might be a complicated financial arrangement with Trump and the family running his Super PAC (who also happen to be the same people who fund Breitbart News and the data anlytics software the Trump campaign used (which Bannon also has a stake in))
1|Trumpet with Russian name proves lie-berals wrong yet again!
1|If Bernie had talked about the size of his dick in Relation to Hillary's, we'd be getting President Sanders next month...
0|I just reread it in his voice.
1|you forgot the
1|God forbid we change the system so that people's votes count equally no matter where they live!
0|Does it really though?
0|It seems most politicians are already sponsored by big banks or big business already.
0|I know trump supporters are big fans of Fox News what newspapers do they support?
0|We can be sure it will involve grabbing pussy.
0|No you can't.. then that would be a democracy ..
0|Yet you know those are the people that will actually get canned.
0|Thank you!
1|People do love their dogs
1|Maybe once they register they should get some sort of religious symbol sewn onto their clothing so we can easily identify them.
0|The TV audio wasn't affected.
1|Well his vote counts as all of the votes because one man should have all that power.
1|But it's the smart thing to do
0|Yeah unions are weak.
0|I really don't see the problem, Hillary would have appointed John Podesta, campaign strategists become White House advisers.
0|Pretty much my whole office believes it's either not a thing or not nearly serious enough to care about right now
0|Be nice
0|Because not only the media is free to create their own narrative.
1|Obviously
1|NEVER saw Sanders do that.
1|...its just a prank, bro?
1|Don't you know, it means black people being mean to white people!
0|Possibly Weld, if he counts as an R and not an L. Also a former MA Republican Governor.
1|Don't worry, that's why we got nukes.
1|Well, it's what they get for having sex!
1|I'm sure the Republicans would care so much if Melania was walking around in the nude all the time...
1|No, that's all left wing conspiracies.
1|To be fair, they need to stop hurting his fragile little feelings.
1|yeah it's so annoying when people voice their opinions
0|Only half of America voted
1|But... But... It's great again!
0|so Pizzagate and the child rape stuff......
0|yea but Trump is up 21 points in the swing state of Arkansas.
0|I'm confused as to your point.
0|I'd personally rather have some restrictions on harmful substances than rampant obesity and unhealthy lifestyles.
0|Oh okay, so what is the biggest lie they told in recent history?
1|"The country is falling apart because my neighborhood now has three of those ""browns"" versus one in 2009... you know, the ones who are a little bit darker than pasty white."
0|Us vs them mentality
1|But don't forget, Hillary had three classified e-mails on her private server!
1|"It's cause they're the ""best people for the job."""
1|Oh this was probably just another liberal false flag.
1|Yeah, it's really too bad I got on Medicaid and as a result didn't fucking die several years back.
0|These guys will cling to power as hard as their tiny hands will let them.
0|My plan is to crowd-source a plan.
1|But they're all without sin so it's cool.
1|Oh yeah man its that easy
1|Oh no, a charity took money from foreign countries to fight AIDS, how similar to what Trump is doing.
0|Is this a writing prompt for a dark twisted comedy?
0|Same person right?
1|this changes *everything*
1|Obviously, what do the Russians care about Americans?
0|Giant Meteor didn't make the ballot, so Trump is courting its supporters with nuclear winter.
1|Thats insulting
1|Well, he didn't used EMAILS so that's okay.
1|A mother always knows
1|It sure worked out well, didn't it?
0|Kind of like Obama &amp; Michelle's 3x+ a year vacations on taxpayer dime-- to the tune of over $70 million total?
0|It's hard to expect much from an article about a tweet of a cropped screencap of a press release.
1|I heard he is also a first rate toilet cleaner, so having him as an ambassador would be huge as far as the hygiene of the British embassy.
1|Yes... it had absolutely nothing to do with 200 assault rifles.
0|If there's a silver lining to this shitshow, it is definitely this.
0|You either can't be serious or don't know much about the subject.
0|It was by far the biggest issue, now stop defending racism
1|You're a horrible person and literally Hitler
0|Have you heard of anyone abstaining to or swapping their vote?
0|A letter to the editor, seriously?
1|Who knows, maybe she did it herself.
0|Considering the average voter is can't read more than a few sentences without switching to a game show or video game, the answer is - hopefully enough of them.
0|Prove that they fall apart.
1|Let's keep committing crimes to make sure oil keeps getting spilled out of rail cars and trucks!
1|I'm glad Breitbart was on top of this.
1|The original renegade Jew, according Britebart
1|"""That's not why, he just wasn't popular enough!"""
0|Juxtaposed with the prescription drug dependence that should be the real focus of the a real War on Drugs and you arrive at the scope of the absurdity.
1|Yeah, conservatives will somehow make out great in this presidency
0|He has may not give much to charity, but his charity gives much to bribe politicians.
0|I think the difference between a book deal and owning a company is that intending to write a book really won't impact your presidential decision making while owning many international companies might.
0|You could live IN Christie..
1|Good thing net neutrality is gonna get demolished!
0|But we were told that accepting the results of the elections is literally the most important and cherished tradition we have.
1|I mean, nothing says that just because you are going to sexually assault someone that you have to have stank breath while you do it!
0|That's very fair, but the chance that it could not only affect the results but also point out a potential flaw in the system is the drive at the moment.
0|And, still giving Donald free media coverage.
1|Yah, he should be praising this revolutionary.
0|and 3 million illegals voting for Clinton means Trump beat her by a cool million.
1|Yeah I'm real terrified about the Muslim gestapo here.
1|Nah, we are just tough on crime so we can keep our citizens safe.
0|Thankfully there is one main stream alternative source.
0|lol.jpg
0|Something has to motivate them to keep going to school.
1|I could be an NFL quarterback if you deduct the fact I throw the ball like a 6 year old girl Basically I'm saying I'm Tim Tebow
0|I'm saying when TPP is axed and Trump slaps these tariffs on imports.
1|under budget and ahead of schedule....
0|What was the thing about something falling out of her pants?
0|But, but, but... That's racist!
1|Oh shit I never thought about that
0|Maybe only people with masters degrees or better should be allowed to vote.
0|The deplorables have always been pretty revolting in my eyes.
0|well... he should not have folded like he did... he keeps supporting a party that screwed him over and in turn screwed themselves over.
1|but but but...he put an R next to his name so he must believe the same stuff my daddy said to believe in.
1|This is right up there with citizens that don't pay taxes for ~20 years or so...
1|But snow!
0|Direct action gets the goods!
1|But its OK, they will only use it to catch terrorists.
0|"Guess it would be futile to point out he's got a TON of ""colored"" (beautiful choice of words from someone whom I can only assume is PC) supporters, but I guess I'll do it anyway."
1|Well what have the last 150 years been, if not an erosion of everything that makes me better than other people?
0|please, show us the evidence of this.
1|If only her opponent had that problem too ...
1|Ah so it all ties back to the religious right
1|The US government gave up on laissez faire capitalism in the 1950s it's been going great since then
0|"It just seems like the original comment was implying that ""we can't do that because it's against the Geneva convention"" while we kind of ignore it if our leaders will it anyway."
0|Lol
0|The best skeezballs!
0|That would have been true, except for the fact that they would have done precisely what Trump supporters are doing now, ie not give a remote fuck about the actual content of the email and just skim it for any sentences to take out of context and use to paint her as untrustworthy.
1|Obvious liberal media.
1|Or you know by 2%.. What a landslide
0|CTR is correct the record, a Hillary super PAC dedicated to spamming Hillary shit everywhere
0|What do you have against her or is it just her business you don't like?
1|Maybe forced abortions but at gun point?
1|... will be too busy toppling the US!
1|It technically is Bush's fault
0|I expect war if they elect someone else.
0|Not until January.
1|I Dropped this
0|Voters aren't blameless little flowers immune from responsibility.
1|Grammar is for hippies
0|If this was true, wouldn't we see foreign leaders trying to talk to Pence?
0|You people and your C word are inseparable.
0|Conservatism went astray when trickle-down came into the picture and the whole lasis faire capitalisim thing took hold, it became more of an obtuse Cult, backed into their own ideological corner at that point
1|If NBC runs out of shows they could always put Jay Leno back in primetime every night!
1|I'm with her.
0|Man, you dumbasses can't even figure out your smiley faces... ;)
0|Dude (or Dudette) you're probably right.
1|Not a Trump supporter, but I think you missed an
1|I'm sure that this is a piece of truth in a sea of lies.
0|What a piece of shit.
1|I'm *sure* they won't consider her presence in that meeting when finalizing details of the deal.
1|Progressives are anti-racist!
1|are you serious or did you forget the
0|The Bay of Pigs was slightly more than an attempt to incite, IMO.
0|I'm not smiling.
1|It's not our fault the only candidate you had deserves to be in prison.
0|"Stop trying to call fake news ""legitimate news""."
1|I mean that's just truth
1|It feels like it says that, though.
1|And spent in on Trump brand clothing !
1|Can't wait for those healthcare premiums to go back down once it's repealed.
1|You check Breitbart and the_D for your daily news
0|"It was pretty similar to ""Sports Shouting"" on 30Rock"
0|I don't think building a 2000-mile-long barrier runs on the same rules as getting a sixth grader to admit they're gay.
0|Because I don't want to be one of the dozens of people that gets stabbed in a stadium parking lot every year.
0|How dare you, 9 year old me marked out hard watching Big Money Vince getting his head shaved.
1|Those women and children should buy some guns to protect themselves.
1|Great, that conformation and other biases magically only affect the left.
0|No different than anti-vaxxers.
1|Good thing we repudiated that policy by voting for Trump!
0|"In that list there are a whole lot of things that start with ""She"" and ""the DNC"", seeing as she was in control of both of those things, that is where the fault lies."
1|But Hillary would be worse, amirite.
1|Sounds almost as bad as Star Trek.....
1|Somebody call that Deare guy!
1|But hey, at least there's no more Muslims!
0|He was just enjoying the moment, namaste.
0|I can't wait to see how his troglodyte surrogates defend this.
1|It's just coincidence.
1|"""Damn libs at it again""."
1|It's just a sheriffs badge.
1|"""But what if someone breaks the glass in a nonemergency next time?"""
1|those feels when you can only afford a white robe and hood.
1|Oh they will fuck it up for oldsters too, probably hand all that money over the Goldman Sachs, where surely it will be carefully tended to in the best interests of the citizens.
0|Username checks out
0|You can't edit Reddit post titles.
0|you're joking right?
0|I'd put my money on the possibility that Trump is selling cabinet positions to the highest bidder.
0|The media has been creating the mistrust people feel for them for years.
0|The HuffingPaint Post has gone full conspiratard.
0|I'd bet money on the intelligence briefings he's been allowed to see being heavily censored.
0|Nope, that's the correct use of the term.
0|I think the true handicap is the fact that Trump is not bound to any facts
0|How can she be 100% right about something that's an opinion?
0|What was your political affiliation before Bernie.
1|The same reason he didn't attend his intelligence briefings, he was clearly spending too much time on the basketball court!
0|Stuff like this makes me even more curious about what is in his tax returns.
1|Exposing the corruption within the DNC is litterally just as bad as hijacking multiple aircraf, flying them into building and killing nearly 3000 people.
0|Yup voted on Monday did my part
1|Democrats were the pro-slavery party!
0|He's getting rid of people funded by corporations and just straight up hiring the corporate CEOs themselves.
0|Trump supporters just beat out christians for most easily conned group of people on the world.
1|On the plus side, we can finally get rid of all these departments that just lie and spread propaganda since they dont do anything.
0|Racist
1|Also the parts of the Bible we say count!
1|Well, he was a false flag Manchurian puppet set in motion by Hillary and Polestar and the RAND corporation so it doesn't matter
1|Sure... put the black guy in charge of the ghettos...\
1|You know, comments like this are why trump won
0|Gary Cohn is the current president and coo of GS.....
0|Spot on.
1|"""We're not the ones who do the fake news, it's all of *you* librul crybabies!"""
0|As much as I respect Romney for this, and Kasich before him, part of me feels like we'd be better off as a nation if those two had sacrificed their honor and integrity in order to gain positions where they could do some effective damage control.
0|Yeah, that's why Bernie did such a great job last night, right?
0|Dude no, they want coastal walls too, they've already said as much

0|I haven't seen brigading this strong, the dirty don supporters really are scared now!
0|Yes... yes I am equally if not more concerned with HRC but that's not the topic.
1|Bill just looks like someone you could get a beer with, Hillary would probably order white wine
1|BECAUSE EMAILS, BERNIE, E-M-A-I-L-S.
0|What Russian hacks?
1|You just need to give him more of a chance!
0|except one of the bills that's being proposed in this session will require the AG to get legislative approval to represent the state in cases.... totally disgusting.
1|"Yeah but ""sticking it to the Washington elite"" was worth it!"
1|Why do you think we've been upping our drone programs?
1|I don't like the right because of hitler.
1|I expect conservative pundits/talkers will say that Trump owns the economy now.
1|clearly it's only assault if they actually (successfully) press charges
0|A decent amount of Berners were down on him during the primaries.
1|But don't worry that one question had a much bigger effect on the election than the hacking did.
1|Too bad they were so confident they got everything right that they didn't leave us any process to amend their work
0|If you're fine with the prospect of a dictatorship, then please move to NK
0|His face is just missing the darker shade and wrinkles of an anus.
0|So really they influenced people's opinions on one candidate but not the voting itself?
1|No Puppet... No Puppet... You're the Puppet.
1|Yep, that will all certainly offer so much help to the poor or lower middle class.
1|But don't you understand... those farmers have more at stake because they own more land
1|Sure, both groups are the same.
1|Bad idea, just keep going with the same tired plays and players.
1|yeah the coastal cities are flooded but damn these libural tears are so delicious.
1|Yeah because the DNC accusing Russia of hacking before any proof (still is none) comes out isn't provoking anyone
1|So your mad that we turned our greatest enemy into an ally?

0|It'd be interesting to see the rationalization of Trump's stoner supporters if that were to happen.

1|but...but...but... what about all the black on black violence?
1|Riiiiiight, and the New Years Eve fireworks everywhere will all be because Trump is the prez elect for 2017
1|"""News"" is meant to be half-sarcastic, you're not supposed to take it seriously"

1|C'mon guys, whats wrong with the ceo of one of the largest oil companies in the world who has strong russian oil interests?
1|To be fair, the current President is a Muslim-atheist from Socialist Kenya
1|But it makes them feel terrible about themselves so its all good
0|I thought he said he wanted to fix it.
1|Let's ban voting until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
1|Definitely not fascism.
0|It is to some but it's been perverted over the last century to mean something completely different to most than it meant over the century before that.
1|Wow now that you put it that way with all your supporting evidence and legitimate claims, I can see that you're totally right!
0|Women, Mexicans, Muslims....When did you stop counting?
1|How shocking that the Grand Bigot Party hates gays, Hispanics, Blacks...
0|We told you Bernie or bust, sorry we actually say what we mean.

0|The video is a CNN source however.
0|You can die from water if you take a large enough dose, shit argument.

0|Break out the butter because Hillary Clinton is Toast with a capital T. And for that, I thank her!
1|Fat cat teacher unions are destroying America
1|Because Obama is a Kenyan born muslim that is secretly working for ISIS and China.

1|I guess she was just being sarcastic
0|Obama has prosecuted more journalists under the espionage act that all his predecessors combined.
0|I guess you watched a different version of a video than what actually happened.
0|I think it's very deplorable that you are voting for a candidate that wants to destroy the 2nd amendment and the Constitution.
0|where not to get your news.
1|Yea just take a day off running for president, skip a 9/11 memorial event and hope that your political rival Donald Trump will let it slide...
0|That bs press release was before they knew about the citizen journalist filming her going comatose and having to be carried into the van.
1|She only rigged a primary
0|She got away with it because the rules only bar candidates from coordinating with superpacs that spend money on ads.
1|I'm sure the unconscious 70 year old will be kicking lots of ass, guy.

1|If it's true, Reince probably pushed him over the edge by threatening his 2020 run
1|Lets make America great again!
1|If only we find the right words, THEN we can violate the Constitution all we want
0|It's starting to pickup steam, but it's still secondary to whatever else is the main narrative--usually some outlandish statement.
1|Well if they did it some more that would be like a red line or something.
1|He should've listened to police and stop acting so thuggish
1|Well, he's not going to make them himself when left to his own devices
0|well, he didn't call it his African-AmericanS town hall and there is one in the picture, so......
0|If I had the answer dude, my name would be on that ballot lol.
1|No, the only pollster that knows what it's doing is the LA Times!
1|Yes because Gary Johnson and Jill Stein have really proved themselves as competent candidates
1|BUT BREITBART IS THE MOST UNBIASED NEWS SOURCE OUT THERE ALL THE OTHERS ARE CONTROLLED BY THE LIBTARDS AND ARE ALL IN FAVOR OF HILLARY OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE LIBRUHL TOO BECAUSE THATS JUST OBJECTIVE FACT
0|I don't agree with you but that was a sick burn
1|Sexists
0|If If If If If If If ... Okie Doke
1|Cute rebuttal, you've convinced me that Hillary never lies
1|Standard when conducting a security review.
0|I thought most establishment - and some Tea Party-er - Republicans hate him?
1|Nah man, I'd rather do something that makes me feel fuzzy than something that actually matters!
1|Facts disclosed by Russians aren't facts and thus must be fully and completely ignored.
1|That's funnier the second time I read I think.
1|But Islam isn't a race
1|Gotta maintain that white supremacy by weeding out those who are actually good people.
1|Lmao yeah, everything bad about trump is completely made up and unreal, trump is a completely balanced guy and his morals are in check.
1|what's your problem, he's the messiah...
1|what I like most about trump is his overweening sense of humility and modesty.
0|Much southern strategy meme
1|yeah she is very believable.
0|Clinton's brother isn't running for POTUS.
1|But God created the earth, how can you think that we have any ability to change it?
1|Pulitzers are rigged.
1|That makes him smart!
1|Yeah, but he didn't shoot Vince Foster in the face so I'm still with Trump.
1|But this as always happened, just leave it alone.
1|yes thats what it was
1|Thats an amazingly rigorous background check.
1|And yet he still won!
1|Lol you libs with your facts and science and logic....
1|Yep, I wondered why he wasn't at the debate
1|But it's not about race, because its never about race, right?
0|Scottie has this sort of aggressive, masculine personality that bugs the shit out of me
1|Some weird feedback/oscillation thing that made it sound like he was sniffling
1|Hahahahah nothing like a child rape joke
0|And he'll blame you when he burns himself
1|Yea, I bet if he would not support Trump this would have never happened and this guy would be well-balanced.
0|I don't think you know what bigot means.
0|This election has shown us a lot of true colors when it comes to the religious right.
0|T_D posters obviously have never heard of it.
1|Trump is just like poor people, you know
1|I'm sure you're an expert on tax legislation.
0|Guest
1|But...cheetochimp made money off the deal...what a smart business man!
1|And if kids are flunking out of school we should shame them for that as well.
0|This is the angle she needs to push in the next debate, it's probably the best way to parry Trump on trade.
1|Please tell me you forgot the
0|Always was.
1|What an insightful contribution.
1|10D Halo and he threw a *lot* of grenades right before he died.
1|What's up with that 16% of Asians?
1|It's not raciest if you're privileged.
0|At every turn I think his campaign is singularly awful, another bizarro chapter is created to reinforce that belief.
1|Obviously this test was created to support Hillary by highlighting all of trumps flaws without supporting any of his strengths.
0|"And their response to being called out is ""You're the racist!"""
1|Haha good one
1|Yep, 5 year account checking in, CTR checks helped pay off my student loans!
1|Because they're all crooked
0|Surf's up brah!
1|You're right, even though she supports it now, we should all be very disgusted and we should elect a sexist bigot and his anti-gay VP instead.
1|This is liberal bias!
1|Looks like they're jumping on the liberal media train
0|Plastic surgery can't fix the innards.
0|But but Obama didn't yell at us enough!
0|That's a rather...liberal interpretation of her comments.
1|'Grab them by the pussy' is just a euphemism for 'taking a woman out to see nice furniture.'
1|Yes, it's the fault of the person being raped.
1|Just more locker room banter you guys, I'm sure he respects the black community very much.
0|Bad, very bad, tremendously bad
1|Dang, there go all of Clinton's hard-line pro-gun supporters!
1|"It's all just ""words"" until they are trumps words then they're facts"
1|Because Benghazi, emails, Bernie Sanders, ISIS.
1|This is huge.
1|They should be out putting CROOKED HILLARY in jail instead of hamming it up with Trump.
1|I'm a veteran, I'm gay, I'm black and I support Trump for realz!
1|That's so beta!
1|Damn, the ACLU is a Russian puppet too.
1|What do you have to lose
0|For sure, everything I've seen just points to him being very passionate about his job, which means he'll criticize people when it's warranted.
1|Yeah, that equalizes everything!
0|It's more like Sanders is Coke and Clinton is a warm can of flat Diet Coke.
0|Don't worry Donald, the Internet thinks you're an asshole, too.
0|He's an American now I believe.
0|Its okay Republican blue collar workers are now against unions and for more corporate power thanks to Fox News.
0|Until next year lmao
0|-70 days in ... Trump lies about X -69 days in ... Trump lies about Y You could probably script up a template for this pretty quickly ;)
0|I think he may be the steely-eyed assassin the right accuses Hillary of being.
0|If you want to assume equivalence in foreign affairs, I suggest you go to the next step and look at how Putin treats his own people.
0|Not in Ohio.
0|Your post was almost as incoherent as Trump's answers in last night's debate.
0|Time is implied.
0|good point.
0|They'll never admit to being conned.
0|I seriously doubt that, but it is awfully convenient that we now have emails from HRCs team showing them doing just this and now you want to claim other candidates were doing the same thing without evidence.
1|Or perhaps the false flag Sandy Hook shooting?
0|I think the plan was to undercut the fact that they're working together and he's stumping for her with this shitty ad.
0|On point.
0|I just read it for the hot photos.
1|It's ok, she's just a woman.
0|Will this include taking land along the southern border to build the wall, because a lot of that land is privately held.
0|Tasmanian hop-scotch 9D backgammon
0|Stand in a road, get hit by a car, stand in the way of a fist, get beaten.
0|Shit, knowing them, they'll sell it with Zyklon Bee, a cutesy little mascot.
0|Losing a billion in a year is pretty spectacular though and goes well above and beyond the typically ebb and flow of business
0|Without consent.
0|I assumed that's how they got her this far already
0|"And the ""both parties are the same"" line dates back to the early '90s."
0|Yet they get all upset and threatened when young people take to the streets for BML protests and other types of direct action.
1|Makes sense since there's no written record about the existence of gay people prior to the rise of the Soviet Union.
0|Yup I totally skipped the 50's lol.
0|"Kind of hard for me to trust a website that has ""liberty"" in its name."
0|Then maybe you can tell me out of all the people who believe there are children being abused in a pizza shop why has only one done anything about it?
0|She has a long history of advocating for child welfare.
0|I think trying to flip AZ is just in case Trump can flip NH, MI, or CO.
0|Common sense is an SJW PC construct, obviously.
0|The president-elect continues to prove he's absurdly corrupt, people won't care
0|Hhahahahahahahaha
0|All very true, but remember, the FDA oversees food and crops, so rather than overseeing medical marijuana from the lens of the THC molecule, it could look at it from the perspective of a whole plant, or even different strains of the same plant.
0|Spelling out the truth is fucking up the election?
0|If he shows up with proof the Russians hacked the election for Trump, pardon would be a small price to pay to save us from Trump.
0|Or did faulty or rigged machines just fail to count them?
0|His charity is the greatest, only if you don't look behind the comb over.
0|Don't ban dissenting opinions, just downvote them into the ground instead!
0|Anybody willing to buy that in the first place didn't need to be strung along any further.
1|definitely not Clinton supporters that did it!
0|Only 3 Republicans died?
0|Yea, they love Slick Willy but point out Trump's impropriety.
0|I member!
0|Must be why they are polling 41% more for democrats.
0|Trump is so dumb he will probably accidentally incriminate himself by claiming Bill was there *too*...
0|Because its bullshit.
0|I think its funny the ad before the video was a pro Clinton ad.
0|Well other than any male member of the Trump family
0|I predict Trump will tweet this in the next few days.
0|Sure he has, on the backs of his workers.
0|It'd hurt him with part of his base if he did, his conspiracy loving Obama hating base
0|And if you do want to support Burnie, consider who he is more likely to be able to get legislation pushed forward under.
1|Well they shouldn't have ruined America then, should they?
0|As soon as they saw names like Christie, Giuliani, and Gingrich floated around, they knew that it was going to be just another GOP administration.
0|That's an issue of medical cost, not why insurance should cost me $50 per week.
0|Well he's not getting those now anyway, so...
0|Yeah, well we don't exactly know that Hillary didn't kill Vince Foster either, but it's not like it's 50/50.
1|but naturally, any talk of hillary supporters trying to steal the election is just conspiracy theory fodder.
0|Yep, its the messangers fault.
0|Distraction and diversion from the real problems: Russian interfernce and collusion, his horror show of cabinet picks, his business ties to everyone and everything and other bad shit.
1|We don't need CNN pieces muddying up the front page...people may miss the new Mother Jones article.
0|Months*
0|Top 25 countries definitely.
1|Seems like a reasonable gentleman.
1|That girl scout was no angel!
0|But Trump said it, himself.
0|In terms of critical thinking and being well-informed, is there much difference between bots and most Trump supporter?
0|This is NOT fact, get back in the herd.
0|So am I.
1|Because if Congress won't confirm a moderate Supreme Court justice because they think he is too liberal, surely they will vote for the most liberal person to be President.
0|That whole freedom vs safety thing.
0|It's too cold to be especially fashionable, so the comparison falls apart in some places.
0|Any caliber round has the power to kill though.
0|the media has to be guarded by riot police at trump events, you have no legs to stand on when it comes to event violence
0|Ha, thanks!
0|Can you present an *actual* argument against fact-checking if you are opposed to it?
0|they siezed them and for a short time before the inevitable follies of human nature that marxism doesnt account for took over, yes.
0|There could be a federal law that official voting-related mail requires no postage.
0|OP doesn't care, he's just spamming this site
0|"""Stops"""
0|Seven hours, so he should get through about one sentence.
0|For those who don't know, the WARN Act literally gives him the power to do this.

0|He's gonna own all the best properties on the board, and a gold plated get out of jail free card.
0|Whether Trump was right about the election being rigged.
0|Pence will be conceding for Trump, while Trump will be holding a separate conference (having broken the chains and locked up Kellyanne) calling for a revolution and saying it was all a big fix.
0|Only dws is corrupt, McConnell is an angel
0|Because anything remotely pro trump gets downvoted to hell
0|I'm certain he just backed out.
0|And if that happens, I'll simply abstain from participating in elections in the future, barring schoolboard and ballot measures.
0|No, feels is what I got when the Dumbfuck and Chef elect started filling his cabinet with donors and anti voters...but yeah call out Hillary to placate your ideals.
0|"What would I be ""shilling"" for?"
0|He should be driving around in a blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle.
0|No idea, but whatever they do, they sure as shit will bungle it like they did in 2014 too
0|Yes, but it only costs $12 now, instead of the $12,000 he spent on the first one.
0|this changes nothing.
1|"Yeah, these numbers look good and are based on facts, but people don't ""feel"" like the economy is doing better so therefore it isn't."
0|If we go by the popular vote less than half.
0|Vote.
0|Bernies teeth in that photo tho
0|"Not to mention that the people who vote in advance are most likely not the kinds of ""undecideds"" whose opinions could be swayed by these kinds of news."
0|What part of this blames whites for anything?
0|"AKA ""I care more about my feefees than what happens to the country."""
0|"""Hahaha stupid liburalz, guess you shouldnt have chosen a horrible candidate that had a private email serv-"" *vaporizes*"
0|Lizard-finder General
0|"You never specified which ""it"" you were referring yo"
1|Will Donald Trump condemn the liberal animals for vandalizing a grave site?
0|It's like slavery back in the day; you don't mention it yet it's harder not too
0|Donald is just that repulsive.
0|No.
0|Because if there's anything that a teetering democracy built on the bones of a failed state that in part died due to the failures of its intelligence agency knows it's how to succeed in first-world espionage!
0|They're not of voting age.
1|"""It's ok if I do it, it's those other people you got to watch out for!"
1|No, because they are communist.
1|That was a real knee slapper, that joke!
1|He has all the documents!
1|Those black people don't know how to vote!
1|Well, the GOP didn't pull their weight.
1|It just is so shut up!
1|"""Can we just say the whole Army has bone spurs and leave?"""
1|Gotta keep it in the family, amiright?
0|Because half of them are Russian up vote bots.
1|You forgot to add
1|Yes, Qatar and Saudia Arabia are some notable philanthropists.
1|Well, clearly, he was just mentally ill
0|More like minutes, probably.
0|Unless you want the CIA and other intel agencies to burn their connections, we won't see it for years.
0|Late the hate flow through you.
0|The Trump legacy; no healthcare, no internet, no schools, and now... No electricity!
1|But Jack Kemp 20 years ago was nice to black people...
0|Fist-a-cuffs is way more manlier.
0|Damn, you're limber!
0|Thats what happens when you deny the existence of climate change.
0|Hillary presided over the destruction of the Dems.
0|When neither candidate is any sort of progressive, neither candidate gets to claim being the most progressive.
0|God I hope so, he has more grain silos to build in Egypt
1|Ok, so when they atracked the cameraman also, they were all about that free speech and first amendment stuff I guess
1|I wonder who they're voting for.
1|No, the Democrats created Trump by calling the GOP racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and xenophobic.
1|Don't forget that everyone in California is illegal or liberal so their votes don't count to begin with
1|I see the lamestream media got to you too
0|Interesting how British folks care :)
0|This election makes me want to die.
0|No no, just the vets not in the room.
1|Zionists, you are clearly not woke
0|Shit turn out for shit candidates.
0|Are Mexicans paying for this wall?
0|Only binary hetero groping.
0|And if Trump wins there will be 318 million new immigrants in Canada.
0|gonna need a solid non discredited source for those claims.
0|I'm sure the minorities priced out of neighborhoods they've lived in for generations would disagree.
0|I'll be proud if Hillary wins
0|Hmm, not in the military locker rooms I grew up in.
0|The SPLC would be an appropriate choice.
0|Spray tans
1|No Poland has never been invaded and is great friends with Russians and Germans.
0|He knows words - he has the worst words!
0|If that constitutes rigging, then hasn't every democratic primary in recent memory been rigged?
0|pretty accurate summary of his campaign
1|You wouldn't have to do that often if you had a billion or two like ole' Donald.
0|Stop placing blame, start working on the midterms.
0|No, she didn't declare he candidacy until April, 2015.
0|That's not what I said.
1|Ah man I rooted for Lenin in the apprentice.
1|BTFO
0|I don't know why the Trump Centipedes are complaining about fairness...almost every story on the front page is about him.
0|welcome to my life!
0|They're an aggregate of the polls, but I'm sure all that complex math is scary, so I won't argue with your precious bubble of ignorance.
0|Your*
0|But she is still going to take their money.
0|Now imagine how he'll be viewed 20 years from now.
0|And Donald Trump is off to the races with a strong one vote lead over Mitt Romney!
0|It's called projection
0|So, par for the course then?
0|"Trevor Noah put it beautifully ""If she coughs, we all die"""
0|I voted absentee, so I didn't get a sticker :(
0|Because you people insisted on pushing through a flawed candidate that polled at signficantly lower levels than the other candidate.
0|This is the point these people are sneakily trying to maneuver around.
0|which means they still want him to be president, they just don't want to feel personally responsible when it happens.
0|Those street tamales smell hella good - but they will give you the runs homie
1|A VOTE FOR THIRD PARTY IS A VOTE FOR HITLER REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
0|And a new non-diseased brain
1|Surely it's over for Trump.
0|Are you really naive enough to think that there is nothing to hide in the RNC and Trump campaign's private communications?
1|As a Bills fan, let's be safe and just throw them both out of the county
0|His silence on the matter speaks volumes.
0|It's their one chance for redemption
0|Ohio here 30 to 40 min wait at mine at 8 am
0|That took investigation?
1|Yeah, hope that guy gets AIDS and dies.
0|Trump wants to hide away and not let the people see him as he screws the country into bankruptcy.
0|Yeah, I mean, maybe he is just spouting some wu-tang lyrics or something.
1|Surely that's the issue.
0|Got my work cut out for me.
1|But they were just little mistakes!
0|this scares me the most!
0|So a few words triggered you to vote against otherwise persuasive arguments?
0|I seriously think they are going to start a war in Syria, like real soon.
0|You don't understand economics
0|You reap what you sow.
0|Yeah, I'm gonna protest vote away a corrupt politician with decades of experience by voting in an inexperienced meathead who is not only corrupt but can't keep his tiny hands to himself.
0|Chris Christie finally getting a chance to be VP after living in Trump's shadow for so long
0|Did you put that cheese that had been sitting on the window ledge for weeks on your tacos?
0|Because he's a shit artist.
0|In Clinton World it's always someone else's fault.
0|I wrote his name in, I hope figures show 5% voted his name in
0|Gotta love a system of governance that allows a numerical minority of the population to commit all of us to a sustained temper tantrum for the next two to four years
0|It certainly wouldn't be my first interpretation, but they definitely tampered with private emails, which had an plausible/probable if unprovable causal relationship to the final vote tally, so I can kind of sort of see how someone could say Russia tampered with the vote tally.
0|It makes for awesome ad revenue when you structure every news site around comment wars.
0|Maybe a generation or two away if the govt keeps treating us like shit
0|He'll finally find out about the star gate.
0|Considering this was 15 years ago ... I think not
0|Donald Trump could literally save the world if he just turned on the stupid fucks who elected him.
1|The DNC is going to start listening to him now, right?
0|Nice to see her pandering to the idiots that elected her.
0|Punk-rock will have a new golden age for sure.
0|Lmao muh Trayvon waz an annohhcent littah boi
0|How funny would it be if the IRS cancelled the audit?
0|Fuck you, redneck.
0|Just wait till we throw Batman v Superman at him.
0|Where's Jon Stewart when you need him
1|It's Grandpa Bernie dammit!
0|Are you sure about that?
1|Another fair and balanced piece from the Daily Mail, I guess that they're taking a break from hiding in the bushes outside Prince Harry's house.
1|I really hope that committee Trump forms to investigate pay to play, goes after this
1|That's some quality political discussion ya got going there
0|It gained a lot of traction but it's been a movement for a while
0|President Elect
0|K
1|They sure did have a handle on those dangerous emails though.
0|Yeah fuck politicians for following their constituency.
0|Is 79 really that old nowadays?
0|No prob, just confusion.
0|"Prez Trump 2017: ""I will pardon Trump"""
0|It remains a false equivalency
0|Good.
0|I don't even feel welcome living in Tennessee as a scientist.
0|He does have a soft version of it; tweets that comes from him mostly comes from Twitter for Android.
0|Putin is making aggressive moves and would prefer America not interfering, so having someone who has no clue about international politics that he can bully is more appealing.
0|This is a fantastic point.
0|Watch us forget just how insidiously effective this type of corruption can be as we chide people for speculating about it, just because the commentary irritates us.
1|BUT BUT COMEY!
1|Nah man most of the country is racist and sexist, social media and online journalists have told me so, also Obama wasn't even a true PoC because he had a white mom and her whiteness infected him and made him evil.
1|Nah they're not reps or disillusioned middle class workers or even angry Bernie supports who voted for the party, they're literally Nazis and they're building FEMA death camps for every minority group RIGHT NOW!
0|Witchcraft!
0|Wish we did this when Obama extended the patriot act.
0|A long walk off a short pier will have to do.
1|Not a big Katy perry fan eh?
1|Right... because Reagan and Nixon were both stable intellectuals with only the countries best interest at heart...
1|Oh yeah, ending global trade and propping up dying industries, that's surely the way to economic prosperity.
1|But they are mad that liberals called them racist, so they are justified in voting for anything, really.
0|spoken like a redditor for 14 hours...
1|Fossil fuel produced electro shock so that's ok.
0|I get what your saying, but when Pence was going after Hillary, Kaine, being the good VP Candidate, was forced to defend Hillary and instead of really digging into Pence/Trump he wasted his time on defending Hillary too many times.
0|He always talked at least about replacing it, he never fully wanted to get rid of it and leave it at that.
0|Festivus for the rest of us!
1|Too PC.
0|::cue crickets::
1|Obviously you didn't hear that Leonard Cohen was killed by the overwhelming grief of the election results...
1|Chinese hoaxes don't melt icebergs
1|I'm guessing you voted Trump then
0|Whooosh.
0|Republicans have significantly more seats up for grabs this year, this are on the defensive.
0|Our first Fuhrer maybe.
1|Can't wait!
1|Yeah, that totally would have worked.
0|Maybe my media is just different, I saw ows all the time, got really tired of it.
1|Thats the spirit!
0|No, it's because they're worried about the instability of Trump Administration.
1|"I guess I should have assumed that ""69Mooseoverlord69"" would have a good grasp on strategy"
0|Again
1|Because it obviously wasn't because there was a gridlock or anything like that.
0|Don't break your neck doing mental gymnastics.
1|Telling people to shut up is a very effective strategy is getting people to vote for your candidate
0|Correct.
1|Is that what those FEMA camps are for?
1|It's a conspiracy!
0|Unprecedented for this country, but the Russians can you tell you all about what's happening here.
0|Apparently they weren't frowned upon by 40% of the country.
0|So does President Obama and Secretary Clinton
0|Fine today, you mean... Maybe not tomorrow.
0|By the likes of Edgar Maddison Welch, for one.
0|He's the one who should have known this before he decided to run.
0|So an average American?
0|Starting it now, thanks for the tip.
0|Do you have a citation that says they were/are paid by someone else?
1|Yeah, I'm sure it was.
1|Look at this show off.
0|PBS does investigative journalism through Frontline (some of the best documentary journalism that exists IMO) and the BBC does a lot of long-form stuff... NPR, PRI, and the other radio folks tend to do their investigative journalism through partnerships (NPR has Planet Money, PRI just acquired the Global Post, the group James Foley was working for when he was killed by ISIS) but is well worth supporting as well, IMO.
0|Thats the correct response.
0|He's a wing nut?
0|I'd rather pay them directly to get retrained or find another job than subsidize a job that is going to be obsolete in the near future anyways.
0|Marijuana's illegalization was a racist act in the first place - the issue is intertwined.
0|"And all the trump supporters say: ""that's smart!"""
1|But It was her turn!
1|White people with economic anxiety are the real victims of racism.
0|The damning thing is that Trump wasn't too toxic months ago.
0|No you
1|No, you see, politics = meme games now
1|Trump literally almost lost GA and AZ.
1|They are all part of the main stream media though.
0|I'm trying to understand his point of view.
1|I mean, how wide is the scope of the president?
0|Worst... analogy... ever....
0|That one is actually valid though
0|I've been sayinghe's like a dumb lex luthor this whole election.

0|"In b4: ""That's the median, not the average"" ""Average doesn't just mean the arithmetic mean"" ""Intelligence is normally distributed, the median and the mean are the same"""

0|It's 2016 and this is reddit, no evidence is needed.
0|Having nukes is barely enough to reach great power status, much less superpower.
0|Just because there are larger issues doesn't mean this one should be ignored.
1|That only applies to the EPA, FDA, etc... All those luxuries like air, food, and water, ... though the later can be packaged into healthy sodas and marked up the wazoo
1|Now remember don't tell them their feelings aren't based in reality, because that's what gets trump elected 'out of spite'
0|I read a whole lot of finger pointing, but how about some solutions?
0|Has a serious contender Republican ran in their primary without dark money?
1|Good point!
1|Maybe he will appoint a manager from Buffalo Wild Wings!

0|It's called deplorable
0|The person I responded to literally blamed progressives for her lose in the general which is ridiculous and deserves ridicule
0|I think the DNC's pro-Hillary tactics during the primary poisoned the 'young voter' well for generations to come.
1|but he is ruining the economy by lowering the unemployment rate and having steady growth!
1|I believe she has done it in the spirit of transparency.
1|I agree, the FBI should never investigate any high-level politician for ANY crimes, it ruins the fabric of our government.
1|Yeah dude, that thing was so full of hate speech
0|That is an excellent summary of how utterly insane this year has been.
1|But, but.. they were armed with black skin.
1|Yeah, fuck *those* citizens.
1|To be fair, they're trying to make the country great again by taking everyone back to time before these former presidents messed everything up for the oppressed white man.
1|That's racist!

1|The caps lock show they are sane.

0|These are the same people that think Donald Trump's name on his companies mean that all of the success is to his credit.
0|You don't speak for me especially when you're saying things I would never say.

1|Why are we talking about 1st amendment rights while Obummer literally takes our guns away?

0|Not any questions that involve science or critical thinking, mind you.

0|Do we know he wasn't?
0|The guy you're answering to is a trump supporter who is trolling.
0|Brady hasn't said anything in any of this
1|Because Hillary has bloody satanic magic on her side.
0|"Because he is literally the only black Trump supporter besides Ben ""sleepy"" Carson..."
0|Maybe the rank and file voters, but certainly not the majority of their leadership.
0|Source showing liberals want them?

0|Anybody who's trying to block the investigation is not a true American.
0|Ok, Goebbels, time for your medicine
0|that's not science, that's just mostly wrong claims without sources.

0|Now now, I'm sure there are enough of them here that they don't need you to stand up for them.
1|you left out all the pedo pizza places they own
0|Fucking tea drinking red coats.
0|Don't forget misunderestimated, which he single-handedly willed into existence as a word that many people use today.
1|You belong in jail u/Cyuen!
1|Just like the election is going to be rigged, amirite?
1|Ugh, they're non-european so clearly they are
1|But then that would make THEM the *real* racists, wouldn't it?
0|All of what?

0|Can he get arrested for this?
0|Karma's a bitch sometimes
0|He's a petulant child.
0|Pretty jaded there huh?
0|The college professor Gestapo is coming....run!
0|There's definitely more than a little truth to what you're saying, but at the same time I think it's important for politicians to admit they're changing their position on an issue when they do so and say *why* they're changing their position, and I think it's alright when the media wants to savage politicians a bit when they try to get away without doing that.
0|I'd still rather talk to salty Hillary supporters than trolling Trumpers any day
0|"And by debunked you mean someone stamped their feet and said ""nuh uh"" without providing any sort of evidence to support their argument"
0|Metaphorically, with an enormous black metaphorical dildo.
0|You won the voting quadfecta.
0|I'm curious as to what this circle-jerk is.
0|Hey I voted for Hillary and I almost never use play doh.
0|Well I can't today because that'd be voter fraud since I already voted and I'm over 800 miles away from where I'm registered.
1|I'm glad someone is working hard to unskew the polls
0|Harambe too
1|Probably because white people gotta get back to their job.
0|He can be under consideration forever, Neocon Senators (People like McCain and Graham) will never approve of someone they perceive as Russia friendly, and together with Dems they probably have enough votes to block his appointment.
0|Jeb is a mess!
0|Isn't Obama currently still president?
1|Those countries look great
0|If anything his comment makes the assumption that OP was a Bernie or bust voter not a Trump supporter.
0|never underestimate racism.
0|Oh yeah, we're going to start executing gays, funding terrorists and abusing women any day now.
0|Right... He's a president for all American unless you were raped by that illegal alien, then trump wants you to keep the baby.
0|Because so far, no one is threatening the lives of straight, white men for being straight, white men.
0|Just like he would have lost if Hillary Clinton had been the... oh wait.
0|No, they don't care because he's white.
0|This man is really about to be the president.
0|This better be the opening skit on SNL tomorrow.
0|He might be frightened that Trump really seems to have a shot at winning.
0|I'm happy for both to be honest.
0|Are any of the former SOS running for president?
0|I thought this was supposed to be the most winnable election in history?
1|Good thing we didn't elect the candidate who wanted to address that problem then!
0|To be fair, the same democrats who complained about 2000 are the same people doing this shit
0|Yes it does, until she answers for the crimes they should be recounted against her.
1|Because when it comes down to it, who really cares about representative democracy, right?
1|but local elections aren't inspiring
0|"For example in the cases of ""Black Man shot by Police Officer"" before any evidence comes out he will say something along the lines of ""the police are racist"" even in cases of justfied shootings like Michael Brown."
0|What if all the Democrats joined the Republican party and ran, but just did a bunch of liberal stuff instead of lowering taxes on the rich?
0|No, I'm contesting your worldview.
1|hey, the election wasn't rigged, hush now trumpeteers
0|Except the Seahawks weren't down by 876 delegates.....
0|Were you alive back then?
0|Don't go on private property then
0|Trump would have beat him by more than he beat Hillary.
1|That seems totally necessary.
1|The best people really.
1|Maybe the LGBT folks should just stop being gay!
1|It could have been $5.6 trillion if it weren't for that tax drain we call NASA
0|You guys will cry a lot in November when Trump wins.
0|As we are laughing at Hillary supporter stupidity
0|Yep, it's called appeasement.
1|Wow the best cabinet possible
0|How do you have reasoned debates when people are cheering that they just elected a demagogue into office who will give lots of power to a foreign dictatorship?
0|Go back to your cave.
0|You mad?
0|"""but he started it""..."
1|You damn commie sympathizer
1|At least god will stop punishing us with natural disasters!
1|He didn't even want to run, he just felt that he had to do it for the people!
1|You better not be one of those pussy European socialist whites though
0|unless of course this somehow proves that he lied to investigators.. that would likely make his immunity void.
0|Do not accuse other users of being shills.
0|if those are marijuana cookies, it's not an easy call.
0|"""hey, i said i was building a movement, but what should i care anyway..."""
1|He'll behead them 10 times each
0|They don't think it be like it is, but it do.
0|I don't think Trump will work for even one of those.
1|Might be part of his plan to ensure reelection
1|yes because only straight white people voted trump
1|Because of the blinding crowd?
0|Because calling someone a Shill isn't conductive to debate, you don't have any evidence, just suspicions.
1|Yes if there's one thing the LGBT community has been begging for all these years it's coal mining jobs!
1|You're right, polls are totally useless and we should never pay attention to them again.
0|Well trump has to store all of the bullshit he fed to his supporters **somewhere**.
1|You elitist bastard!
1|You're a racist!
0|If the deplorable shoe fits, wear it.
0|Good fucking riddance.
1|So they go and destroy their own neighborhoods and shops... smart!
0|At this point, I wouldn't be too surprised if he made a new reality show from the Oval Office where you can call a 1-900 number to vote on stuff during commercial breaks.
1|It was blm
1|It was all a con, what a shocker
0|Thems the rules though
1|It must feel great to have that privilege.
0|Is that why he loves the uneducated?
0|Or if people actually cared about what is true rather than who is shouting the loudest.
1|Not if you ignore California which shouldn't be counted because it disagrees with me and is too liberal for my tastes!
0|Oh you mean trying to get people to believe that Hillary laughed at the idea of gay people getting thrown off buildings didn't work?
0|I really wonder who the person that did this plans to vote for on November 28th.
0|"""Two frivolous lawsuits against Trump might make it to court."""
1|No, Obama can't run for a third term.
0|Many in the Bush administration were fans of the show because it spread the lies that torture gets good, actionable intelligence, and that it's okay for 'good guys' to employ it.
0|Agreed.
1|Boy that protest vote/nonvote is paying DIVIDENDS!
1|That's working out for us bigly in Illinois.
0|I just threw up in my mouth a little.
0|Yea when we were getting worked in national elections letting guys like Reagan and Nixon run train on black communities with the war on drugs...but yea, PURITY!
0|You just argued that the executive branch can't violate the first amendment.
0|God damn dude you did more work than Hillary did.
0|They should give you a managerial position, that's textbook right there.
1|Shocker
1|I'm sure he'd say the same thing about Chelsea running the Clinton Foundation in he reverse scenario.

1|Hillary hearing about the Flint water crisis question before a primary debate in Flint is clearly more urgent and outrageous than Trump essentially setting up a monarchy before our very eyes

0|Swing and a miss.
0|Dems needed this lost to just wake up.

0|I should really tell these Trump supporters that liberals absolutely ABHOR it when people randomly put money into my bank account and buy me kegs of cookie dough ice cream.
1|Well Muslims dont deserve rights
1|If you don't like America, why don't you geeeeeet out
0|The majority of people by far voted for clinton, though

0|To paraphrase Nixon, it isn't pussy grabbing when the President does it.
1|Yes, everyone who voted for trump is one way, and everyone who is liberal is another way, because life, and everything is that black and white.
0|In the fantasy dimension that exists in their brains where he is the tough, strong savior of white culture and will exterminate the foreign hordes.
0|Well, it predicted 2008 and 2012 with almost 100% accuracy, so it's so far been a good source...
1|Don't you know that Hillary lost because you call people racist and stupid!
0|Emails and Benghazi are the only two things I ever hear brought up from people who are anti Hilary.
0|I did too.
0|Don't forget O'keefe, who used to work for Breitbart, which is basically a Trump mouthpiece, and was directly paid by Trump.

0|I'm happy with Trump actually.
0|Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
1|That explosive story about 600,000 emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop being tied to the Clinton email server doesn't add up.

0|Sex tape with his daughter in the Oval Office.
0|I'm stealing that.
1|Vox is such a greatttttttt source for the truth
0|Well, one is saying that we have some deep seated issues in our society and the other is calling for the denial of rights to an entire group of people
0|That's how stupid the GOP are.
0|It's after the Builderberg conference, but before the Elders of Zion summit.
0|Trump's impotence feels more like a feature than a bug.

0|If you're a white, male, heterosexual, middle class, young liberal, you can afford to not vote for Clinton because you don't want to compromise your beliefs... as for literally anyone else in the country, President Trump is not an option.
0|You underestimate their cowardice.
1|She sees opportunities to build her experiences and relationships for personal gain, totally evil
0|I like how Louis CK's term for them is catching on.

0|Next month: oil drilling begins in national monuments.
1|It's a Russian political witch hunt
0|Our system of movement is correctly referred to as either a constitutional republic or a representative democracy.

0|Checking in as a millennial whose already voted, so that's at least 1!
0|Yeah, I think the GOP's stance on cutting juice box subsidies really hurt them with that demographic.
0|Here's hoping he's on the roof, waiting to jump after he loses.
0|I don't remember Mexico saying they would never work on NAFTA with the US.
0|As many as the right wing gave Obama.
0|Then, shortly thereafter, blame directed at Obama.
0|No, more like how he respects women in public but privately he grabs em by the pussy.

1|Because voting third party is such a waste
0|That's why you're voting Clinton I presume?
0|"I'm actually Canadian, so... Either way, I'm not going to ""think highly"" of people who choose to be jerks."
0|...that makes it sound like you actually believe this.
0|We're living in the safest time in human history, there are no major wars, crime is incredibly low, and idiots are making it seem like we're about to have WW3.

1|Pfizer being a state that also supports terrorism
1|Despite Bernie's multiple affairs and history of bragging about sexual assault, like all guys do?
1|And Jim Crow wasn't bad because black people could just shop around
0|Unfortunately almost 40% of voters LIKE that.
0|Which fit the profile described?
0|Trump has been running for president for so long that the early Simpsons seasons have jokes about it.
0|That stuff gets processed really far down the line with career civil servants so it wouldn't matter so it wouldn't really have anything to do with the administration.
0|Shoe fucks clown.
0|and their defunding of education helped
0|The executive branch should quietly shut down the New York office and fire everyone involved.

0|None of what happened?
0|Link?
0|I was hoping she was going to say that she'd return his donation.
0|He'll let the force guide him.
0|But of course twitter wouldn't exist, so he would just be ignored
0|Which is why you listed all of Trump's accomplishments.
0|I'd take Romney at this point
1|Clearly that means he's a democrat.
0|What did he say about her health and fitness to serve?
1|False flag!
0|Yet half the country seems to be clamoring for one
1|No no no, he's waiting for Hillary to reveal she a satanist, before he swoops in and saves us all from WW3.
0|Did you just assume my race?
1|That must be why we never hear about Trump in the news
0|We are, but we're also powerless.
1|Just vote again!
0|Someone convince me that this wouldn't have been the same case for Hillary considering her lack of an affinity for unbiased press.
0|I said in my reply that she was only down by a few percentages.

1|No way, he said that some are good people.
0|Nah that was the fun boy loving SA.
0|Its not in their nature to move forward.

0|President Hillary Clinton
1|You really are one tolerant person.
0|Exactly
0|When the guys only credentials are that he's good at business but the business world is panicking that's a damn good sign we've fucked up.
1|It's cause those who voted for Drumpf were racist sexist misogynist homophobic islamophobic transphobic hillaryphobic logic-phobic math-phobic, you name it!
1|But what about all those russian voters?
0|Or maybe there's no point in defending Hillary anymore since she's lost?

0|And people who support trump that are not racists or bigots...
0|The meltdown reached its full force
0|"His supporters are the only ones giving ""blind trust"" here."
1|If you don't count media crucifixion and losing a presidential election to be punishment, sure... But yeah basically the same - I'm sure that server has made Clinton millions of dollars.

1|Because her gender had nothing to do with the constant drumbeat of manufactured scandals that resulted in zero prosecutions.
1|Because he wants to make America great again!
1|hey, that might hurt their feelings!
1|Yes, having significantly more them half of voters against the president should be a meaningless fact.

0|Seniors (well, wealthy white ones anyway) are the only group that the Republicans **don't** seem hell-bent on plotting a war on.
1|Yeah there is no way trump will ignore his security briefings leading to another terrorist attack on us soil which will then galvanise the rest of the reactionary idiots in this country behind him.
1|The police asked you questions: you're guilty.
0|'Atta boy!
1|Great.

1|Facts have a known liberal bias!

1|Don't you guys know sarcasm?
0|Russia won't do anything, remember Crimea and MH-17.
0|i would vote for a pack of ketchup over either of them.
1|Tyranny of the minority is much better
1|Obviously this was a false flag operation aimed at defaming trump supporters.
1|Unions are bad, unless they are Police Unions.
1|Well if Obama hadn't ended racism, the alt right wouldn't have had any reason to organize.
1|Just like Hillary told 'em to.
1|As opposed to all those other times, when we get the full classified reports published on Google Docs
0|*SOURCES*...which you know, obviously can't be trusted
1|Fake news only matters after the primaries
1|Silly lubril white people can't be terrorists.

0|Maybe for trump a great American is one where he makes the most money.
1|I bet that's what Heinz said in 1933.
0|Well shit, that's even scarier.

1|'Cause ISIS
1|"But it's not their fault, it crumbled due to the shaky foundation Obama laid in his ""false recovery""!"
1|Omg what do you mean do you support a psychopath I'm literally shaking
0|This is the same left who insisted on giving a Nobel peace prize to a man who was in military conflict all eight years of his presidency
0|This guy is campaigning in a different state almost every single day, call him anything but lazy and you may have a point
1|Did the GOP redraw state boundaries after 2010?
1|Yeah, thank god white people are finally in charge.

1|Even Swampthing packed it up and moved elsewhere!
1|a 6 year death spasm....that is almost as long as a Sting tantric orgasm!
1|tweeting about it bigly
0|One of those two lied us into wars.

1|But my guy is one of the good ones!
0|"It's not ""rich"", but you'd be really shocked just how poor large swaths of America are, especially rural America."
0|Mississippi is still in the union so that no real state is last place in any metric.
1|Ruining the Christmas present of a family member putting his name on a cause he doesn't support, what could possibly go wrong?
1|But we have F-35's and they have MiG knockoffs.
1|sure, he's a hero.. i guess..
0|State borders don't exist besides for in our minds; the government is actually manages things, but it is true that what the government manages is relative.
1|But he appeared on TV because he's wildly successful, not because he needed the money
0|Say that to the hundreds of families suffering from not knowing who killed their loved ones, never getting justice, and waiting 50+ years to find answers.
1|Oh well that changes everything
0|the cycle is that liberal politicians improve things, people get lazy and fat like pigs and vote for repubs, who wreck things, rinse and repeat.
1|He needs to get started on that wall, stat.
1|Nice to see such a reliable source.
1|I hope you dropped this
1|its still kinda vague...i dunno...its so wishy washy...and she is super dishonest because my dad and rush limbaugh said so.
1|She may have been ahead by millions of votes but she obv cheated her way there.
1|"He had an ""R"" next to his name, and lived in *Texas*, where *real* Americans live, so he gets a pass."
1|But he didn't tell them the gravity of their decision.
1|You dropped this:
0|Just wait until it's you or someone you love whose death could've been prevented if they had insurance, then we'll see what you think.
1|Proof, we have something better then proof, the word of the CIA!
0|It isn't gossip if it's about Trump's treatment of and attitude towards 55% of voters, anymore than Clinton contracting pneumonia is gossip.
1|Nice username Comrade, I give you two vodka and 1 Adibas track suit as congratulations for victory against imperial USA pig.
0|Exactly what I mean.
1|Well Trump won, so there is no reason for him to be grumpy anymore.
1|It did wonders for Argentina
1|But when he can't it'll be the fault of the blacks, Jews, Mexicans and Muslims!
0|Because it only takes a modicum of research to come to the realization that voter fraud is a statistically insignificant phenomenon.
1|That will be fair and balanced
0|Times of Israel talking about Jews is like CNN talking about Clinton.
1|This is a relevant comment, because as we all know his disgusting opinions have totally changed since then

0|U mad trumpster diver?
1|"its even funnier than when she said ""delete your account!!!"""
0|Oh geezus if became reality...
1|Yes but it's OK, apparently private industry can police itself.
1|But CNN is fair and reliable
0|I am always amazed that so many on Reddit see that big pharma is only out to make money at any cost when it comes to issues like this, but totally trusts these same corporations when it comes to vaccines.
1|Trump has a purple heart... he's the real hero
1|Putting that word in all caps sure convinced me
0|That's the voice on my head when I think of Powell
0|Yes, cause that's all he can do right now.
0|"ok now i just feel bad for saying ""thank you for your service"" nonchalantly all the time."
0|Yeah, if it weren't for him we might have that charming and not at all batshit crazy Ted Cruz guy to deal with...
1|But remember, folks, sexism isn't a thing.

1|Who cares about low information when you have high energy?
1|That's sexist.
1|Yeh, it was great how they got them to torture people for us
1|Illegal means they're from a place I dont like!
1|That hes to honest for his own good?
0|I didn't realize how many people could see and accurately predict the future until I started reading Reddit politics.
1|It's not a crime it's a misunderstanding
1|It's not Breitbart so obviously biased.
1|Yea, she's not literally the first person in the country to fight against this kind of campaign finance mechanism.
0|lol this sub is getting desperate
1|Which makes you weak!
1|Oh yes I'm sure they are just not catching the 5,000 white people that murder per year and that's why the poor black people look so bad in comparison
1|Yeah, Georgia is in play because the region just hates her.
1|The progressive case for Clinton is overwhelming!
1|The sun is gonna destroy us in a few billion years anyways, so why does it matter if we die out in the next few centuries?
1|But you'd let him do it because he's a star.
0|Haha
1|Because we have to send a message to Clinton and the DNC that they way they treated Bernie is not right.
1|Yes, your average officer, someone who just went to college before enlisting, are the ones sipping cocktails with politicians
1|Because cops just pick people at random, then escalate situations to the point where they have to shoot someone, for no reason at all.
1|How else are they going to get job experience?
1|Here is your nose cover.
1|"She also caused the many year drought in Syria, and made the Syrian government say, ""Not our problem,"" when the Syrians asked for help."

1|Trump surrounds himself with the best people!
1|Just further proof that the elitist gubment regulation is out of hand
0|Would crushing up ADHD meds and snorting them give one similar symptoms?
1|Once six month old news shoots to the top of one 24 hour news cycle, Hillary will be finished forever!
0|Did Brietbart tell you that?
1|Thanks, rich and famous actor!
0|How exactly does one pay income taxes on negative income?
1|The third one is on foreign policy but I'm sure that Trump is spending every free moment he has studying for that one so that he has a command of the subject.
1|Unidan, I didn't realize you were involved with politics
1|He hasn't finished downloading and reading it, so he really can't say
1|I bet Hillary totally hasn't done that.
1|Well yeah, they are all the same dont you know - two sides of the same corrupt oligarchic regime despite their smokscreen of widely divergent policy positions.
0|How does that work again Rudy?
1|You had to google it to find out Buzzfeed is trash?
1|That's right here in Indiana we offer our best and brightest!

1|But this will be mitigated when Trump turns California red.
0|"You could just alter this headline to ""Trump brags"""

1|Well you seem like an open-minded person, I'd really enjoy discussing the principles of true conservatism in a constructive manner with you!
1|How dare a group support the rights of citizens!
0|Damn, it's been a year already?

1|Yeah he's a real tough guy isn't he?
1|Well, I mean Ben did choose to be black.
1|Sounds fair and balanced.
0|The debates are getting so hyped up that now I feel like they're going to be uneventful: Clinton supporters will think she won and Trunp supporters will think he won and the polls don't move much.

0|Rod and Todd Flanders?
1|If they had just been Christian, Europeans wouldn't have had to send in all those armies.

0|My suggestion would be to avoid a discussion board then.
1|Yeah, but he didn't give speeches to Goldman Sachs, so it's OK.
0|The reason is that there's no evidence whatsoever and it would cost taxpayer money.
1|Yea, I'm so sure they are
1|Sure, that has always been a good idea.
1|Oh gosh, I wonder if the movie will be able to make a profit now.
1|Yes, clearly the *most* important thing!
1|sigh...
0|I see what you did there.
0|And stripping the regulations designed to make sure they don't crash and need bailout again is also such.
1|Everyone who disagreed with Madame Popular should have dropped out because it was her turn
1|Yeah, but it'd be 100% if you excluded all the brown people here illegally.
0|He said HWHAT?
1|Yeah, a margin of almost 1% in the popular vote is pretty much the same thing as almost 50% more electoral votes.
1|*Shaking*
1|Man, it sure is great that the democratic process we have now stopped nepotism and corruption in Trump's election, as well as allowing for a progressive candidate to take the reins!
1|"Yeah because ""conservatives"" would never do that!"
0|Stand by for record to be corrected.
1|Also global warming is a scam.
1|And that's the good news about Ms Conway.
0|Yea, because he totally had it before this comment.
1|You can totally see him doing that with his victory rallies and tweets.
0|It would be a lot easier to take this stuff seriously if it was possible to take control from a presidential office.
1|TAKE IT BACK THAT'S WHY TRUMP WONNNNN
1|Come on, everybody knows the whole reason the economy is in the dumps is because Obama hates businesses, so these companies like Exxon can't afford to hire anybody.
1|Guess you shouldn't have gotten pregnant then.
0|This is an attempt at explaining the previous comments.
0|This is a sentence explaining that the previous sentence is missing punctuation.
1|UNFIT FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE CANDIDATES HAVE TO BE IMMUNE FROM ALL DISEASES UNLIKE SHILLERY

0|The only person saying that is a known troll account.
1|All this evidence is overwhelming
0|Don't forget sexism.
0|"As Samantha Bee aptly pointed out this week, ""identity politics"" is just the right's derogatory phrase for civil rights."
0|And I'm sure you guys will still blame Hillary if/when America is attacked successfully thanks to a certain someone being unprepared or unwilling to do the job of president.
1|Well, California does have the economic output of a major country so that is possible...except for all the socialist in California.
1|I DO GOD DAMN LETS GET EM
1|They're just sitting there, why don't we use them?
0|Yes, because nothing was brought to light in this election about hillary colluding with corporations....

1|Yay for Nazis in 2017
1|Yeah, they mention him *by name*.
0|I think they were looking at Obama's legacy and not seeing an improvement in their local job economy and decided going the other direction might work.
0|Trump probably thinks he can stop global warming with a cold war.
0|Throw super-liberal Washington on that list too, I remember too many times going over to a friend's place out of high school and found them dropping more n-bombs than I could count, from the guy who lived in a McMansion and was upper-middle class to the borderline white trash guy who lived in a crumbling duplex.
1|Yes i'm sure this FBI investigation is going to find something just like the other two did
1|Well thank goodness we have the electoral college to protect the interests of Real Americans against those costal elites.

0|The FBI told the RNC it was hacked back in June.
1|Why should he try to reconcile anything, he won!
1|Or if you do, you must be a sucker for the ages.

1|He must have really hated Christmas then.
0|Anyone here think that if Obama would have came out with Don King at his first press conference that it would have caused a HUGE shit storm?
1|"Yeah, it really lends weight to the whole ""I voted for Trump because Hillary is a warmonger"" argument."
1|Ignoring the points the guy makes to deliver your one liners is really persuasive and demonstrates that you are right
1|Yeah, biased against nuclear!
1|Wow, reporting the stories that really matter, Independent

1|YEAH, SHE CAN HANG OUT IN THE KITCHEN!
1|"""They hate us for our freedom."""
0|Obama doesn't need an executive order to change drug scheduling, and it is not an overuse of power for him to change it.
1|That must be why she lost the popular vote
0|He probably gets a job related to people in charge of those industries after he leaves office.
1|Because of economic anxiety.
0|Let me know when Trump is held accountable for his actions like running a fake school to swindle people out of their money.
1|Just ask Obama to turn it off.
1|Nah we've got nukes, we can just outlast them
1|Damn dude they're just emails, calm down.
0|It slowly emerges that Donald Trump has the mental capacity, ego and morals of a side show barker...
1|They can't be using identity politics, because Straight White Male isn't an identity, it's a blank-slate default.
1|Wow *this* sure looks like a credible news source we should all trust.
1|Wait, by pizza, do you mean little boys?
1|Ah, now it makes sense!

1|Totally not a perfect example of the racism inherent in the trump movement that makes ethnic minorities think that other candidates are a better path for America
0|I think that is very safe assumption

1|But Trump told me black unemployment was 60% and he tells it like it is!
1|Another massive conspiracy.

1|The true alternative here folks
1|I love the smell of dead American soldiers in the morning.

1|"Hahahahaha.... From ""she is disgusting and doesn't have the mental or physical stamina.."" to ""meh, hope she doesn't die"" Yeah... Sooooo classy."
1|Good thing that she had no prolonged interaction with anyone since Friday then right?

1|So when are the mods going to censor this thread too?
1|Polls are now fake again.
0|Bc that way he can't plead the 5th.
0|I understand why people feel that Hillary is untrustworthy, but why do Trump supporters just automatically assume he is trustworthy even though he has done everything to prove the opposite?
0|lol yeah if you go elsewhere you aren't fully welcome here.
1|I'm sure Powell has incredibly intimate and accurate knowledge into the private life of Bill Clinton
1|Was the Syrian half the brilliant half, or the asshole half?
1|Right, because until this happened they had the pretense of impartiality.
1|Wait, I thought that was the rational behind 'Hillary for Prison'
1|There is but shockingly the only officer on scene that didn't have one was the one who did the shooting.
1|Trumpets + powerful woman = reasoned discussion

1|A complete unreasonable request.
1|Obama cut it in half!
0|It's so catchy!
1|Never ever post that again

1|The gays are 'degenerates', please
1|"Hillary will insist on adding an ""h"" to the end of all words."

1|Yep, Trump is just like Tesla
0|That's why it's perfect.
0|does anyone know when they will add this to their forecast?
0|He also pledged to give the majority of his wealth to charity, something Trump would never do because he's obviously running for president to attempt to overturn estate tax law because he thinks he's a Rockefeller
0|So you'd shoot Zimmerman?
1|Ooh this oughta shake things up.
0|Yeah...but all those damn CHINESE buffets!
1|But how do you pay holograms tho?

1|Nah, Kennedy and Johnson were fascist
1|But ICE endorsed him.
1|Yeah, but what does she look like?
1|When accusations come at Trump they are false and when they comes at the Clintons, they are obviously true
1|And among the Alex jones types banking is a code word too... you know because the rothchilds run everything and elders of Zion is a true text
1|Cause that is a really good argument.
1|Yeah, I'm sure the slavers made a point to only enslave the non-religious ones.
1|He needs to keep it secret until after the trial
1|Can't trust the news, it's conspiring against Trump and out to rig the election so Trump loses.
0|It was before muslim radicalization which happened after colonial powers sort of left the region
1|Obviously no one dislikes Trump unless they are paid to.
0|go back to your safe space where you dont get triggered then.
1|No they are just standing up against the murderous Clintons who shamefully tried to discredit them.
1|...which makes the attempted rape totally ok!
1|But it's only fair to give Breitbart and Russian state media equal consideration to the Times and Post.
1|Welp, that's exactly how young latinos like to be referred to by Clinton supporters, a SUB category.

0|Yeah, some easier than others.
0|ok dude have fun!
0|I've got to imagine Republican politicians would rather Mike Pence be POTUS anyway.
1|Give that man a purple heart!
0|Because I want them to suffer.
0|Interesting that the GOP isn't very interested in an actual corruption scandal.
0|Is that what you think I'm doing?
1|But he was ROBBED!
0|Are you saying that all republicans say racist things?
0|After Trump signs a bill of of attainder declaring Hillary Clinton guilty?
0|It's got to be a big comedown from being a county idiot to being a village idiot.
0|that makes him smart
0|"turns out it was less ""liberal tears"" and more ""troll ejaculate"""
0|But Donald said he is worth three times that
0|503 or 404
0|Maybe it's the folks who don't want her to feel better soon who are downvoting those comments?
0|They would hate the idea unless Trump actually did it at which point they would now sincerely love it.
0|lmfao okay then
0|Lol.
0|Shit, and they always said liberals were the ones who ruined Christmas.
0|Jokes...they're a thing.
1|But the free market^tm will just step in and improve everything!

0|Holy shit he got him
0|Hillary's plan on the environment involves massive investment in renewable energy
0|The cyber probably worse...

1|Why do we let mexicans vote if we're not going to let dead americans?
0|I thought Obama would take all our guns?
1|That's just smart
0|Grain silos
0|The only thing they understand would be to vote them out of office but as we just seen it doesn't happen.
0|Sick burn, H3PO4.
0|When The_Donald and Stormfront explicitly play up bothsidesism to normalize their extremism in defaults, it's more fair than you give credit for.
0|Unless the electoral college decides he's unqualified.
0|I mean Pence has already ignored and denied everything Trump has said, so I doubt its hard for him ignore everything about Trump different from Reagen.
0|it's a joke i know who she is hahaha
0|If you don't understand something, just claim you know more than the experts.
0|Whereas Trump has trouble stroking his little donald with his little hands.

0|it's the only way he lets the public know just how dumb his ideas are
0|First past the post.
0|You mean to say that my wife's facebook feed was wrong about him being a crazy gun welding democrat?
1|Because that is exactly what is happening with the black vote right now after they elected obama
0|These people are running for office, it's pretty fair.
0|The douche and turd sandwich analogy has never been more relevant

0|No
0|Whose supposed to be the balding with her?
0|"I was just thinking that, ""Oh, the Dark Lord."""
0|True, but I personally find that terrifying rather than funny.
1|And we all know Trump is never reckless.
0|Tax cuts for some, MAGA hats for others!

1|When Trump says Clinton's emails are the worst scandal greater than Watergate, he means that he asked Russia to steal the emails, and he's surprised that's not a greater scandal.

1|Yeah lets go back to 7 day work weeks and mandatory sterilization!
0|Also, it's very easy for Trump to trick a lot of people, from the short-sighted to the completely blind.
0|This is what people should be doing
0|That's assuming no candidate gets to 270 electoral votes on Monday during the EC vote, right?
1|Hillary supporters have been very classy during this whole campaign.
0|We never meant for you to hear that, so it's hardly fair to judge us by it.
0|Really, Id almost be okay with Bush taking a 3rd term over Trump at this point.
0|That's a confusing argument of hearsay and fabrications.
0|nope, but they finance him.
0|"That's exactly the ""everything will be okay"" attitude that got the Dems asses whipped so hard last night."
0|As an hispanic, I assume predominately Cubans and some legal Mexicans went for Trump as they usually go conservative.
1|Well close enough
0|Likely, but we know for certain that the State servers were successfully hacked twice.

1|We must be new to politics

1|Right.
0|They want to know which one to sacrifice
0|I expect that VP Mike Pence will involuntarily intern her in a new, publicly funded, conversion therapy clinic.
0|After years of the Republicans calling Obama a socialist, the word has lost its sting.
1|Because look at the polls, and he is literally Hitler, and racist and sexist and a rapist, and only racist xenophobes will vote for him and they are a small minority in this country!
0|All about that optics...
1|Ya because Republicans worked together with Democrats for the past 8 years
1|And the rigged election had nothing to do with it
1|Don't argue with someone who clearly knows more than us all.
1|"""But Hillary was the same..."""
1|Yeah he'll never win

1|What a good use of resources

1|Hey he got them VA.
1|Love trump's hate.
1|And those Bernie or bust people are being ridiculous!
0|Only feels matter
0|So sad that people like you are completely oblivious to how identity politics is utterly killing the left.

1|Yeah but Trump said mean things!
0|Got to (Obviously) call BS on that one.
0|Why wouldn't it be?
0|I didn't need to register because my local government didn't purge the rolls trying to disenfranchise me
0|If it's like any other trump product, they'll get screwed as well.
0|Dude, it's not a narrative anymore when the Russians are fucking proudly admitting it.
0|This is my shocked face, when I have been telling people for months that he doesn't really have a plan, and that he was a democrat not too long ago, and doesn't really give a shit about either side.
1|Compelling argument.
1|Yes, pointing out the hateful shit Trump has said and done is just spewing hate.
0|Well people are moving out of small towns and into cities so evidently so evidently yes, it is pretty appealing.
1|Cause electric cars are so environmentally friendly...

0|Corey Perry is a saint.
0|Great time to get housing insurance with all these 'protesters'.
0|I think Sanders even if he doesn't want to run will feel obliged to run because of Trump
0|If it's an honest assessment, it will cover everything that led up to the Trump victory, including the role of the DNC, money in politics, the alienation of the working-class constituency in favor of monied interests, Clinton's political and ethical baggage, etc.

0|DOJ released the statistics, though I'm sure you'll find a way to say they are illegitimate.
0|To point out the hypocrisy in attacking Trump for turning out to actually be equally as despicable as Clinton, rather than just a close second, then claim that somehow makes Clinton a viable choice.
0|As if we needed more.
1|Yeah, he would have had to look Chelsea in the eye *then*.
1|Well, we all know the Iraq War only happened because HRC voted for it.
0|Don't you forget it.
0|Except he only names CNN.
1|How else do you expect them to stop the SJWs from censoring speech?
1|No, their canidate can do no wrong!
1|His ascension to the head of the DNC will certainly bring middle america back into the fold.
0|Right, Hillary should have run as a Republican.
1|Oh yeah, if there's any overriding characteristic of Donald Trump it's being level-headed and rational
1|WRAP IT UP YOU PERVERTS!
0|You must have 0 grasp of any public policy or economics.
1|Spoilers!
1|Oh duh how could I have been so blind

1|Yeah, no such thing as Civil or Criminal Forfeiture of assets!
1|I know right, appointing the CEO of Breitbart News, a site founded by an Orthodox Jew and staffed by many jewish editors is as big of a fuck you to the jewish people as it can get!

0|The volatility/unpredictability is a bit disconcerting.
1|When she's a hot piece of ass, it's not nepotism.

0|So you will continue to ignore the statements from our intelligence agencies that our elections were manipulated by Russia because you don't trust the Mainstream Media?
1|omg quit holding peoples racist actions against them you're so meeeeeean
1|Don't worry I am sure Jeff Sessions will keep Trump in check and will prosecute him if he violates the constitution.
1|So... he's saying no Pardon for Hillary then?
1|Don't forget that it's Obama who was really racially divisive

0|"""If I'm attacking you, you are a terrorist."""
1|Well Pence wasn't running for President!
0|We are all willing participants in a racist, fascist regime.
0|Well since Dems have controlled the presidency for 67% of the last 24 years, that sounds about right.
1|Because Denmark doesn't have issues at all with immigration and the integration of Muslim peoples
1|Yup there are no hospitals in rural areas
1|Yeah the vitriolic reaction to Trump that has most likely made sure he has no chance in the election certainly shows that Americans are okay with rape
0|Vigorous mastrubration would do that to you... got to be more careful, bud!
1|Yeah, but who cares, black people are going to suffer too.
1|Wrong!
0|can we give Darwin awards to every trump supporter who does this?
0|And two brains.
1|Yea, fuck the middle class.
1|Workers losing overtime pay is part of making America great again.
1|But what about magic underwear?
0|Right, but it'd not like trump.can undo that immediately
0|Happy Holidays Guys!
1|Well, Hillary should have put a law prohibiting this in place.
1|And democratic voters in red states just don't exist, right?
1|You sound like literally Hitler
0|What's that, like .002% of the electorate?
0|Democracy...brought to you by Trump Steaks in partnership with American Airlines.
1|We can clearly see that respect by how well we run th VA.
1|The greatest.
0|They aren't working in Wisconsin where their jobs exist because of trade with Canada
0|And that was widely considered a gaffe at the time, also.
1| WRONG The correct answer is Gary Johnson voters cost Hillary the election
1|Looks like the middle and lower classes are finally getting their America (and money) back from the hands of the greedy establishment (:
0|I've seriously wondered this so I would appreciate an answer: how does a Trump supporter justify the proof that the Trump Foundation is actually just a slush fund and is the very definition of self dealing?
1|Her emails and Benghazi.
0|i will buy land in mojave, need to get some transcendence stuff going on out there in the desert
0|ITT: Trump supporters who don't realize the point is to demonstrate that there is a double standard, not exonerate Hillary.
1|If passed I'm sure this law would have no negative consequences
0|"Oh pretty pretty please show me the ""real"" news sources that you got this ""truth"" from."
0|Then I appolovize and can have a conversation about how Obama really has some serious legacy issues liberals and those on the left must grapple with before we move forward with a new DNC.
0|They are better in the original German.
1|I read it on Infowars so it must be true.
0|it's a private school, they can do whatever they want really state schools better hang the flag though
1|What, you don't like your money supply tied to something someone digs out of the ground?
1|Well they benefit the liberals, so of course it's good...
0|Your delusional
1|With a recount
0|Good one.
0|I mean I'm no FBI agent, but getting 30k printed emails with redacted emails would be both annoying and suspicious.
0|What stage of grief is this?
1|F
1|Why can't America properly appreciate his genius?
1|Sounds like Russian propaganda to me.
0|Thanks Obama
0|TOR will most likely earn you a visit from the FBI.
1|Drain the swamp!
1|Ah yes, Trump's gonna ban all medicine and make it illegal to be a doctor
0|We never found out what she said to Goldman Sachs, but Hank Paulson's with her.
1|It's Obamacare's fault
1|Yeah but noticing reality is a really fringe belief.
1|look if poor people didnt want aids they shouldnt have caught it
1|I guess he can feed his family off of liberal tears?
1|He's just keeping up with the Hitler stereotype, nothing to see here move along.
1|Nice of Obama to show leadership on the topic like usual.
0|Oh it would solve many problems.
0|I'm not opposed to that, but it's going to cost a lot more than $750,000.
0|He hasn't been in office for awhile now, these stories belong in gossip subs or news, not politics.
1|Yeah, look at how much richer President Obama got after passing the Affordable Care Act.
1|46%, looks like he is saving only the jobs of those that voted for him
0|It not click bait it's for shadowing.
1|Don't worry, Melania Trump is gong to put a stop to bullying!
0|I've never understood why in America companies feel the need to clearly show their support for a political party.
1|welp, I'm convinced.
1|Surely going further left will bring back rust belt working class voters.
1|Another day, another triple K event!
1|"As long as he puts 3 fire emojis and ""EXPOSED"" whenever he makes any diplomatic tweets, I think we're safe."
1|Yeah that is why they went with the original route under a predominantly white city.
1|Well, Putin thinks he's a good guy, so there!
1|If you have more than two wives, you're probably better at women than anyone else.
1|He totally won all those online polls, so why would he need to practice?
1|Well, Trump already attacked them once, why not attack them again, amiright?
1|Clinton will let ISIS vote in the November election making it rigged while on her deathbed.
1|This is a sub of tolerance.
1|Or they'll probably put all the Muslims at the top of the spear as the human suicide attack squad... *wink* *wink*
1|"""Those damn Muslims coming over here forcing our kids to learn Arabic Numerals, we need to teach them Western Christian Numerals"""
1|LITERALLY SHAKING I AM SO SCARED RIGHT NOW
1|How dare the establishment biased MSM use Trump's own words against him, verbatim.
0|"But he went on stage and said ""Vote for Hillary Clinton"" more than once anyway?"
0|Can Obama drone strike innocent civilians?
0|We don't want cheap imported goods from China.
0|As opposed to people who view the world through we partisan goggles, with blinders attached.
0|It took a bit to see if calling a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist and impotent man a role-model would poll well.
0|Didn't seem to matter when Obama used airforce one to campaign for Hilary.
1|But depriving poor kids in school a free lunch is a great motivator for them to get out of poverty.
0|Tears of happiness
1|Making America great again!
0|Yep, everything Obama fought for (which isn't much, really) will be wiped away and history will state that Trump was a direct consequence of Obama.
0|Then why are you still here if you think that?
0|can't we like, profile this sort of thing?
0|Lol you're so rich, can I have some money plz?
1|WOW WHAT A FUCKING SURPRISE SURE WAS A GOOD IDEA TO ELECT HIM AS PRESIDENT
0|So, in MMORPG parlance, can the ranged cycle aggro so that he dies without ever actually hitting anyone?
1|Bu-but if we isolate ourselves, America will be great again!
0|It already is... in most Kindergartens when they're learning colors... you'll find the orange fingerpaintings next to the red and yellow ones.
1|I know I'm shocked.
1|Because those damn liberals are just keeping the job creators unable to create jobs because of taxes or something.
0|Matthew Miller @matthewamiller Comey refused to even tell Congress if FBI was investigating Trump camp for Russia hack, but regular updates on Clinton are apparently A-ok.
1|Yeah but why care about the long-term or overall effects when there's short-term personal gain to be had?
0|I thought he said the elections couldn't be hacked?
0|Bill Clinton isn't running for president though
0|Let's not
1|Oh right, if everyone does it then it is totally ok.
1|What can I say, I'm an optimist.
0|Why is it absurd to try to ensure that only mentally capable people have guns?
0|Portman is very anti-Russia, luckily.
0|He was right about most states, both in the primary and general.
0|Of course he can, he was a KGB agent for 16 years.
0|Thanks
0|He still wins without Michigan.
1|"In my experience, people that use the term ""sheeple"" are always the most credible and well-informed."

1|But he's, like, a really smart person!
0|And no gays.
0|no fly zone
1| drain the swamp
0|Oh come on, that'll never happen.
0|Nice try champ but not quite
0|I'm suggesting what I think will happen, which is that more GOP electors may come out vocally after the deadline, and that others will silently protest.
1|Not American, so obviously Musk is a foreign agent looking to influence the political system
0|Nahhh...Both Third Party candidates are leagues better than Clinton/Trump.
1|Yeah, if this election has taught me anything it's that refusing to accept the lesser of two evils can never backfire in anyway.
1|THIS IS WHY PEOPLE VOTED FOR TRUMP
1|Unless it's smoking the reefer by those dirty hippies
1|Yea there's definitely potential for trump not to become president at this point
1|I'm sure his business interests won't influence his decision making at all
1|I am sure he will be as calm as Hillary
0|Let Donald have his swamp, it looks good on him.
1|I know, that Risotto recipe is truly bone chilling stuff.
1|Clearly the real conspiracy is in the connection between a pizza parlour and child sex trafficking.
0|That would require a constitutional amendment because it's in the constitution that electors are based on House members + Senate Members.
1|If it's not from Infowars or the Daily Stormer, I just can't accept it ^^^^
0|I guess there is that.
0|Those emails were hacked (or leaked) long before this.
1|Those facts are just your opinon

1|Racists are not usually afraid of saying things.
1|No no only Trump supporters are the ones that send death threats
0|Undiagnosed and Untreated Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

0|that just means he's successful and we should admire him!
1|It'll be a mandate, fer sure...
1|"Considering there's zero reason for ""racial tension"" in America, yeah, he's totally slimy!"

1|Totally
1|This seems like *exactly* what Alexander Hamilton had in mind when he proposed the electoral college in the 1780s.
0|Can we just make up rules so he's not president anymore?
0|They haven't.
1|That's *president-elect* god emperor to you, filthy peasant

1|Yeah they've definitely been running a campaign based on race and sex and not the VAST experience and qualifications gulf between the two candidates.
1|If they wanted to vote they should have taken the day off work and went sooner.
0|Both of them are perfect for America, TBH.
0|No she doesn't.
0|Truth has a liberal bias
0|That is my point, it is fucked up that someone can win an election by almost every manner but still lose.
0|And the pivot continues....
0|When it gets addressed or they go to sleep?
0|But *I* hate waking up in darkness!
0|My understanding was if you didn't register with an ID you needed one, or if you were doing same day registration.
1|Getting a home cooked meal and good night's sleep at Rafael Cruz's house before his big day, or something.
1|What safer place to store that bombshell than Anthony Weiner's computer?
0|Clinton is cooked!
0|"The ""reports"" seem to primarily reference that one individual in Trump's team did not know they needed to staff the West Wing."
0|How?
0|The Cuba embargo violation is still hurting the GOP thanks to Trump.
0|And it's from a site called truthfeed, so it must be true.
1|You forgot the
0|They have many kids also, so this could go on for awhile.
0|And one of the biggest demolition companies in the USA
1|I for one am shocked
1|It's clearly a racist dog whistle.
0|Because the GOP's continuing war on education is working?
0|"He isn't ""just like"" Hitler, he is just more like Hitler than most other politicians."
0|oh i have agruments for that, i'd gladly engage in that direction.
0|Hopefully the senate stonewalls the shit out of Tillerson
0|Cuz who else would...
1|Wrong.
0|In the last 24 hours alone I've had Trump supporters telling me that RT is a reliable source of information and that Tiananmen square wasn't that bad.
1|And taking away jobs from hard working McDonald's employees.
1|From Breitbart, rofl... yeah reputable source
1|Half the time was spent configuring `cygwin`, 10 minutes was spent running `grep` for classified, and then they're done.
1|Yeah, that's a minor change.
1|Can you imagine if he smoked, with no control over his eating habits
0|Happily the charges were dismissed today, the prosecutor was charge-shopping.
0|Air force one is going to need to be a swamp boat by the time Trump is done.
0|Bushes and Clinton have plenty of safeties when it comes to this sort of thing.
0|And Trump will nuke someone over a twitter feud.
0|No, it was obvious she was very uncomfortable but under too much duress to do anything about it.
1|but Trump is the only one suppressing voters
0|Considering how hard the media makes it out for minorities to get a driver's license it must only be white people out there driving.
0|By showing the world that a pathological narcissist that sexually assaults women, thinks racial and religious discrimination is not just OK but desirable, and has a lifetime of experience conning people into thinking they are getting a good deal from him only to screw them over for personal gain is someone we want to lead us.
1|And yet she somehow allowed Anthony Weiner to escape her murderous clutches.
0|No, but ever since we split with the Berenstein Universe, things have gotten kooky.
0|Hopefully it's himself.
1|The whole world is rigged!
0|We're gonna have the best disasters, folks.
1|no, thats clintons army of homosexuals who are gonna rape every man they see.
0|"Well yeah but I mean ""Oliver North is the last fucking person who should be criticizing anyone on dealing with Iran""."
1|Sorry, forgot the
0|Did we watch the same debate...?
0|There is also a complete lack of grunts and snorts.
0|None of you should be surprised that Trump's pre-election insanity hasn't magically turned into bridge-building statesmanship
1|He had a lot of free time on his bye week
0|Or over the learned nobody else was in on the joke
0|Real recognize real.
0|Thanks for proving my point.
1|Sarah Palin, always a hallmark of sanity...
0|As a New Yorker, he might just get my vote
0|You're right I'm sure but isn't that purely hypothetical?
0|He will surely get 80% of the black vote with this policy!
1|"I guess we were wrong about what he meant when he told his supporters to go to ""certain places"" and watch for cost fraud."
0|Hillary said she will go out of her way to shut down coal, whereas Trump says he will save it, when really he'll just let it die a little slower than Hillary.
0|I'm curious would edibles be a factor in this, because obviously you can't smoke 1200lb of pot in that time frame, but could you possibly eat enough edibles to cause an adverse reaction?
1|That's..... RACIST
0|Source?
0|Would you support making immigration easier?
0|The expanded universe has some Stormtroopers complain that it's hard to see out of their helmets, and their blasters are inaccurate.
0|Smashing that glass ceiling.
1|Oh, I'm sure there be no trouble from a Trump White House.
1|Yeah, but Breitbart is golden.
0|Assuming you mean legal immigrants he's never said anything bad about them.
1|Remember... It's the corrupt establishment that folks are punishing.
0|Distrust != Hate But one who lies so much probably deserves both.
0|Well of course there's going to be some rigging, what do you think all these Republican-sponsored voter ID laws are for?
0|It's pretty clear from his tax returns that he has little income and large amounts of debt.
0|How non-racist of you to make broad generalizations about white males.
0|and 2.6 million to HRC
0|"""Hmmm, maybe as we've been selling out the working class to the rich through literally every administration for the last 40 years we should've also done something to help the people most adversely affected by that outcome."""
0|Yep and that shit turns off gun owning voters, those voters who do actually turn out and vote.
1|The media knew this, that's why they rigged the election for Trump so they can have this tension for the next 4-8 years
0|she's released her Heath records, if you'd like to dispute the lab results, do so:
0|An outsider who...sits at the fucking top and stares down at people like ants?
0|Because all the polls have been so very accurate thus far...
1|We're back on top!
0|You are being satirical, right?
1|Well it WAS her turn
1|it would be the highest approval rating in history if those millions of illegals weren't allowed to be polled!
1|"well, Trump DID constantly say that things would be so different ""your head will spin"""
1|she is...and the White House is their most valuable business asset for the next 4-8 years!
1|...well that explains Trump then...although you think they'd be able to create a more realistic wig!
1|So he can pin any crimes on his family and then pardon them?
1|"""Obama MADE me be a racist!!!"""
1|By the Jews!
0|This.
0|Don't forget the Goldman Sachs exec rumored to be Treasury Secretary.
0|Or that she was lying to get attention and has no proof to back up anything she said and has such skirted out of the public eye now that the election is over and her bluff has been called.
0|Something about President-elect Dumpster tweeting nonsense conspiratard I think.
0|I'm done trying to explain why we have the EC to you simpletons...
0|It depends on how much the next nominee has to buy this place out.
1|All he's doing is talking for the poor oppressed minorities that can't speak for themselves, Is that so bad?
0|We don't know that
0|Not an argument.
1|Remember: Hillary's the corrupt one.
1|Just shoot the tumor, bro!
0|That means Obama is endorsing him too
0|The ironic thing is that we put these kinds of people in power
0|but not unpresidented
0|So what you're saying is she'll be the prime suspect when he dies shortly after the election?
1|Are you implying the Hospital CEO's don't deserve $20 million per year!
0|And only talk about it if you are trying to impress Billy Bush.
0|"""Almost"" lol"
1|But some neocons didn't like him, so obviously not establishment!
0|"TIL ""got rid of"" means ""transferred to a nice cushy job for helping out."""
1|you forgot your
0|Even though CNN repeated and repeated that she prepared both speeches that night.
0|Clinton has lost the critical epicurean vote, for sure.
0|because its funner this way
0|It's dangerous donald.
1|Sure, better than (God forbid) a black guy or woman.
0|None, some people are just bitter that the rest of society is moving on from the transphobia of ages past.
0|As a joke, at that.
0|I feel embiggened.
0|And I think a lot of people will follow Bernie into that new party too
0|Bro, almost everyone supporter the Iraq War at the time.
1|Yeah, fuck my fellow countrymen, doing something to get them employed again doesnt make sense unless it benefits me!
0|We upvote for your sins.
0|No one cares
1|You mean you don't?
0|Fucking Christ, Trump is basically Cartman.
1|Obviously the liberals just hid them, so Obama could get elected.
1|Politics and the medical field are so similar thanks for showing me the light
1|She sounds like a great person
0|This.
0|Because politicians always say what they mean?
0|You wouldn't talk about a ventriloquist without mentioning his dummy would you?
0|They just want to force the people killing their parts of the country on the rest of us because they're to fucking stupid question right wing media.
0|it didn't help that he was right either
0|It may be a typo but I think sarcaustic could be a good word for when you are sarcastically taking a caustic position.
0|An efficient secretary who is also Satan.
1|Gotta keep the black voter turn out down somehow, best way is by traumatizing them against voting while young.
1|Because if you can't trust them, who CAN you trust?
0|You very obviously have not been paying attention.
0|Hillary supporters are being rediculous now
1|You dropped this,
0|Clinton lost Florida in part because a much larger percent of Latinos voted for Trump than the Clinton campaign expected.
0|How about that wall though?
1|It's fine the DNC took money from downtickets during the primary to elect their queen and it totally didn't bite them in ass
0|No, that makes you an ageist and/or a Hebephile
0|Actually did not mention Bill Clinton, but did add a touch of complaining about how it's all rigged and how he is going to fix it all himself because he used to ban insider and this all a smear because he is betraying all the insiders for the interests of the common man...
0|Yeah...By 2008, Bush looked like he was very much done with being President.
1|Please like they pay any taxes.
0|Lol please, stop embarrassing yourself
0|I wonder what he would do if handed all of America's classified information.
0|I don't want the narrative hijacked by these people either.
0|Yeah, the really smart folks just stick to Breitbart and Pravda.
0|She moved on him like a bitch.
0|Terrorism benefits two groups: terrorists and authoritarian politicans.
0|He doesn't even have to launch an attack, he just has to say something stupid to someone like Kim Jong Un or keep creating international incidents with China.
1|That makes him a genius for continuing to take advantage of those opportunities.
1|You are going to have to give up controlling the entire world.
0|I thought that was the reason for PACs?
0|What makes you think Republicans have any interest in replacing any of the services they cut with anything?
1|Look man, hate tweets are WORSE that physical attacks!
0|^Any ^way ^the ^orange ^glows..
0|Is this a sign that the Democrats are shifting to the left / Bernie Sanders style progressivism?
1|It won't happen and afterwards Bernie is going to name Dean his Vice President nominee for agreeing to not challenge Ellison's nomination to DNC chair.
0|As much as I dislike Rand's philosophy and writing, *Atlas Shrugged* has the unique distinction of being my favorite book title of all time.
1|What does a Holocaust scholar know about Hitler?
0|Steve Mercer is the financier of Brietbart and also the primary funder of Trump's campaign.
1|Yeah, but as everyone here knows, the VP is the one that makes all of the decisions like this...
0|he has the intimidation factor of a plush golden retriever but i'll take it
1|Oh that's just nitpicking
1|oh good I was worried for a sec
0|He definitely likes to grab women by the pussy.
0|In other news: Grass is green.
0|Oh, experts say.. Well, then..
0|But breitbart is fact free, that's a big difference.
0|Next polls will be based on number of lawn signs, bumper stickers and political hats seen by pollsters.
0|Can't wait til everyone tells me why this is bad.
1|Sorry, I need Google to pre-chew my vision or reality and decide what meets their standards for state-sanctioned-truth ^^^^^I ^^^^^don't, ^^^^^fuck ^^^^^you
1|In a deeply sincere fashion, I'm sure.
1|Legacy.
1|TAIWTW
0|I wonder if they get paid a salary or if they're like paid per post and have to document every post or something.
0|Because?
0|Good
0|'Smug' has lost all meaning this election cycle.
0|It's almost as if issues aren't entirely black and white, and sometimes regulations are necessary while other times they aren't.
1|That makes him smart!
0|It's never Hillary's fault.
0|This is a fine evasion of reality.
0|You are so wrong, it's ridiculous how you are trying to argue about something you know nothing about.
1|Yeah, it's not like delaying a presidential nomination for Justice for over a year is something that's never happened before
0|So if black people are not disadvantaged, why are they more likely to be arrested when they commit the same crimes, be sentenced for longer sentences, more likely to get the death penalty, be disproportionately poor, go to schools with lower ratings than schools that have higher white percentages, be more likely to be suspended from school than white kids for the same actions, be less likely to be called back despite having the same resume as a white person, lose the most wealth out of any group in the great recession, have a higher unemployment rate...
0|I would love that just to see the GOP literally explode.
0|You mean watch as the rest of the country blames Democrats even though Republicans nearly have full control (Supreme Court is the only one holding out).
0|In '08 or 2016?
0|The Onion articles just write themselves.
1|Pffff, they are only advocating for policies we want so we vote for them.
0|The only thing better than change is exact change.
1|Something something lying/impartial data.
0|nah, they'll just call him a cuck and ignore it like they always do.
0|Trump was basically spouting Putin propaganda that Assad and Russia were the good guys while they slaughter innocent people.
1|I wonder what would have happened if all the people that approve of him had gotten off their asses and voted
0|Well one thing is for certain, it's not going to be Trump.
0|Drain the swamp... and then refill it with hot piss.
0|Elite unit that helped kill bin Laden gets expanded power to ~~hunt terrorists~~ serve the interests of the US government, which may include silencing enemy of the state, and hunting terrorists.
0|Yeah, I'm tired of all these BASIC bitches.
0|Clinton won't likely have a say about the release of information resulting from that investigation.
1|How can anyone stop the Mexican rapists if they have no experience committing sexual assault?
0|You're stupid, really really stupid
1|Its true man, he held a gay pride flag
0|Psssssh come onnnnnn, don't even give me that!
0|so what is the correct answer to that question statistically speaking?
0|Make America great again...
0|Then they're just Trump voters to me.
1|Trump is the perfect combination of deeply corrupt *and* fundamentally lacking in experience!
1|If only there was a mandate separating of church and state
0|All 17 of our US intelligence agencies are brainwashed?
1|I thought progressive taxation was about progressive liberals not progressive levels!
1|Even all the Hindu ones?
0|or Bobby Kennedy.
1|PARTY OF SMALL GOVERNMENT
1|Relax we're only a week in.
0|Gaslighting.
0|Yes, complete with pantomiming.
0|She just chalked up another one three days ago in haiti
1|yea but we won't need trade when we're great again.
0|...But fancy magic underwear... Count me in!
0|Stop trying to reason with him, he's just a self-admitted troll.
1|Yeah fuck the next generation!
1|Didn't see that coming
0|Do you believe that anyone who voted for other candidates was illegal?
0|"It also says slavery is ok, meat and milk should not be eaten together, that pigs and shellfish should not be eaten as they are ""unclean"", and that people should be stoned to death for wearing clothes woven of two different threads.."
1|Hey those hats are expensive bro
0|This election has been so weird: I keep making this mistake too :(
1|Yeah, Republicans have shown nothing, if not their magnanimity.
0|she was very calm and well spoken, not much of a rant.
0|Remember when Bush was your worst Republican nightmare?
0|And socialism is one of those things that already exists in america...
0|i don't think op gets this at all.
0|Depends on how they go... I could see him having a train wreck at the first one and announcing they're biased and a scam and he won't do anymore.
0|Figuratively... it really and truly does.
0|Huge what?
0|Word
1|Oh, didn't realize he didn't get to see the show.
1|Not if there's probable cause... you know, being black.
0|I am so glad the media has finally learned how to focus on the really important issues.
1|Whichever one confirms your beliefs
0|I mean no one except the ACLU cared about NSEERS, but that was a year after 9/11 so people were a lot more concerned about terrorism.
1|Trump had nothing to do with it.
0|"Well, who would have guessed that ""fat free"" means that the fat comes for free..."
0|He actually has a lot of positive messages for his voters amid his grievances.
0|Now there's just deporable, bubonic infested fleas lurking about.
1|With toxic air and water, there are fewer tomorrows, see it's a winning formula nothing to worry oneself about.
1|Ah yes its our fault for the world being racist, its always the silly liberals attacking people that are different than us
1|LOCK HIM UP
1|I expect this man will immediately have his security clearances revoked and will be under intense House investigation
1|I'm sure she will undergo intense House investigations, be castigated by the FBI, and then be asked to resign
0|General Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor is a phenomenal decision.
1|And the satan worship.
1|Whereas no one on the right every threatened Obama's life.
1|Don't worry, they'll have a war going in no time to take our minds off this.
1|Everyone be sure and thank her for the Trump administration.
1|The office is for the person the president has sex with.
1|Bring back coal, bring back coal, bring back hack, cough.
1|Right, because how could that go wrong?
1|Very smart people told me it was coke, lots of very smart people and he snorts it off nude models, believe me.
0|I now see the kind of person I am dealing with and am moving on.
1|International Journalism is RIGGED
0|I guess not accepting your 20 college educated acquaintances (if they even exist) as being representative of the country as a whole means I'm taking my ass out.
1|That makes him smart.
1|What an educated and informed line.
0|"""Neo-Nazi"" is one less character than ""Alt-Right"", so happy tweeting!"
1|Obviously we need to start grassroot campaigns to get out the dead voters for midterms.
1|Especially no ammendments regarding the electoral college right?
0|are they gonna make out?
1|Because the gay community is responsible for so many homicides
1|What an unpatriotic thing to say!
0|How many collective down votes does americanstinker need to get before it's an auto banned source?
0|Nah, they have both mastered the art to convert it to speech
1|At least Putin is strong, unlike Obama!
1|Yeah but Bushes War Crimes are nothing in comparison to **BENGHAZI**, will you not think of the victims families?
1|Shocking that an Abrahamic religion has been in America since George Washington
0|Ask yourself why you are questioning charitable donations to a Foundation run by a former President that actually does good rather than commenting on the corrupt behavior of a President elect.
1|Remember: Republicans are the hateful, homophobic racists and the Democrats are the tolerant ones!
1|Man, he sounds like an asshole
0|"His (presumed) actual quote from 2008: ""As new citizens, your new President just happens to be a n****r, but just because he's a shiftless African, he's still your damn President, and if you don't like it, you need to move to a different country like I plan to do..."""
1|But then we'll have an autistic VP!
0|Actually voting isn't
1|Well one is a group of patriotic citizens.... the other are obviously savages and leeches on society.
1|It didn't involve emails, so it's all good.
0|"Isn't the term ""power grab"" used frequently for less when progressive legislatures are in power?"
1|The most systematically oppressed group of people in the US: young white men.
0|I don't want to be in this world anymore!
1|Yeah, OBlinger is obviously a problem...
0|But I thought PC culture was destroying America.
0|Jesus Christ, please don't let this man into the white house before he instigates a next world war
1|The best way to change something is to do nothing
1|ok sure
0|It's a bittersweet ending but I'm glad to hear that at least he didn't get life.
1|Obviously we should just roll over.
1|They're just exercising their right to open carry.
1|Yes, but the real sin is that they have a D next to there name
0|I guess we should be grateful Falwell turned the offer down but there is still the problem of DeVos...
1|You mean a neocon corporatist third way shill... If you didn't steal the primary from Bernie by not voting for him, he would've won the general where I'm sure there would've been a bunch more far-left voters.
1|I'm pretty sure you love Trump
0|Frankly, they'd be idiots if they didn't antagnonize Trump's crowd of racist, short tempered, morons.
1|but the GOP and Trump would have totally gracefully accepted these results had the shoe been on the other foot
1|There are two sides therefore both sides are equally to blame
0|"The word used to mean ""free"" before it became a pejorative catchall for the right."
1|Don't forget all the pressure she must deal with heading an international ring of sex trade smugglers.
1|Ya because celebrity opinions really seemed to swing the last election
0|The purpose of the EC is fairly apparent if you read the Federalist Papers.
0|Oklahoma City is as red as they come.
1|TIL Fish-human hybrids are real.
1|Uh oh, the Puerto Rican Arts Alliance is going to end in genocide
1|Land of the free as long as you don't look, talk, or act different from me
1|Ya man fuck those people struggling to pay bills or put food on the table because their gov't screwed them over
0|Cut that hair and put on some damn shoes!
0|"You go tell the millions who voted for trump they aren't getting shit, because ""its just business"""
0|"He's really terrible at this whole ""white supremacy"" thing."
0|Childish name-calling is the only plank left on the Democrat platform.
1|See, Trump is a job creator!
1|yeah because we should only care about politics once every four years, then sit back and allow the president to do whatever the fuck they want
0|You're beyond help.
0|I'm sure the GOP will come up with a free prayer-based solution to this problem.
1|In Canada we don't use Zip code
0|Like I trust drunken frat boys with guns..
0|Yeah, that's not going to happen either.
1|no that was Obama's fault, member?
1|And the money for this will just fall out of the sky!
0|Blame the current state of the Electoral College on Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican Party, the 1800 election and the 12th Amendment.
1|Plus that video audio of him admitting he grabs them by the pussy is another bogus lie made up by the Chinese.
0|Which is why I said 'electoral'.
0|IIRC Teddy Roosevelt was a third party candidate.
1|Yeah why should Democrats win when they all live so close together
1|But the electoral college is about making sure everyone's vote matters, no matter where they live, guys.
0|Tell that to dubya
0|"It's OK, the LOLZ coming for that disaster will be a couple years down the road when all the christians realize every single mosque funded a school with tax-payer dollars using their ""voucher"" program."

0|I will eat a car.
0|It is Kanye's only good song.
0|I would really like this if it wasn't for the fact that Trump has no fucking clue what he is doing.
0|Please let neoliberalism die, or this will keep happening
1|I see voting for Trump is already paying off in leaps and bounds to his supporters.
0|"Like what the Boston Globe did in April by printing a future based on Trump's ""vision"" for America."
0|Its very PC to accept money from countries who throw gays off of buildings and arrest/torture/kill women for driving.
1|no im in the kkk and i spraypaint swastikas.
1|we all did 9/11
1|His swamps get the best ratings.
1|Yeah, that's it!
0|President for Profit.
1|Yes, because NYC becoming less financially stable can do nothing but help the economic situation of middle America.
1|Will you just guaranteed your spot in hell!
1|Putin for President!
0|Banning people won't change the election results so us ducks wouldn't care anyway.
0|And how do the lizard people fit in?
0|It's filled with innuendo and suggestion of wrongdoing, but aside from that, there's very little there there.
1|Well I have to give it to Pence for being introspective for a change.
0|Every criminal, psycho, and Islamist I know respects 'gun free zones'.
0|And veterans
1|Did you just *assume* your own gender?
1|Yeah, the US doesn't have any affect on any other country around the world.
0|Deflect with old fake news
0|The childproofing continues.
0|A party based on the literal in interpretation of the Bible, of course they don't care about the truth.
1|yeah, appointing a black man that has actually lived in public housing, wtf
0|Kamala Harris
1|I know, let's throw up the B signal and see if we can call GWB away from his painting in this hour of greatest need
1|Yeah, I mean how fucking dare a business think it has the right to refuse service to anyone in this age of special snowflakes
1|imagine if Trump did this imagine Trump lost and then demanded recounts in nevada, and new mexico, and then Trump supporters said electors should betray their pledged vote to clinton yeah thats not disruptive to our democracy at all
1|someone in hollywood bashing Trump - how brave
0|"While it's true on the fringes of both parties, the ""X cause didn't fail, the people failed X cause"" approach is far heavier in conservative circles."
0|And Trump *was* the most unpopular candidate in American history.
1|They're people too right?
1|Yeah, don't forget the 2,000,000 people there who voted illegally
0|As a Trump supporter, I assure you, I'm all for it.
0|Someone please photoshop that.
1|I'm sure Jill Stein regrets saying Hillary is worse than Trump.
1|Don't they have ways of shutting that whole thing down?
1|Brietbart obviously
0|Ohhh if that were only true perhaps the light at the end of the tunnel isn't a speeding train.
0|It also lasted about one speech.
1|Well I didn't see that coming!
0|That show's still on the air?
1|It would have had to have been said in an email for anyone to care.
0|Including rape a 13 year old?
1|Cause that's what college teaches ya
1|Yeah Wired, tell me all about how SOLAR FRICKEN ROADS are going to save mankind.
0|But those damn leftists and their war on Christianity!
0|Because CIA and FBI cannot function unless a guy who is not even a president yet listens to their presentation?
1|Please tell me you forgot the
1|But Cassandra didn't use emails like Hillary, that corrupt bitch
1|See, if only Hillary spoke in inferences and slogans, and called every lie sarcasm like Trump it would have been on the level
0|Where did I say that?
1|Yeah, I'm sure Shelby will do the right thing.
1|Same as *East Germany* you mean...
1|Alot of honest political discussion here in the comment section
1|Because your partisanship has nothing to do with it
1|...the horror
0|Not great unfortunately but more reliable than random redditors.
0|Ivanka will be the first woman President
0|Dumbest comment today, maybe ever.
1|Yes, it was clearly Obama's fault.
1|Those rights only matter when we are talking about number 2.
1|Anyone who isn't part of the new Politburo is a closet globalist.

0|With Trump, in context is always somehow worse than out of context.
0|Or just go talk to Ken Bone and wonder how he's still undecided.
0|You're not a liberal if you support a military dictatorship.
0|And travel size bathroom products.
1|So, having sex with horses is supposed to help?
0|If you say there is a correlation between approval ratings and votes then why the fuck are you arguing with me and not the 10 people that are saying otherwise.
0|That'd be me.
0|I hear he likes to do the cyber.
1|Just because you came here ~~il~~legally doesn't mean you should get to stay.
1|But emails they haven't seen must have significance!
0|Too much, unfortunately.
0|Donald Trump raped Ivana
0|Lol what a fucking moron.
0|Trump seems to think that airing commercials that are literally his own words in context is nasty, so yeah checks out.
0|That's might be more comforting if exit polls were worth shit.
0|Rule 35: If something political goes bad, there's a video of Sanders warning about it.
0|Summery of the trump campaign.
0|I personally would rather solve the issue with diplomacy, not threats.
0|Also his sons are on twitter claiming Trump survived an assassination attempt... even though no weapon was found.
0|Well, he might be reading headlines only!
0|Devin Nunes is a member of Trump's transition team.
0|$2.5 million.
0|Kasic wins again
0|Unless the gun is pointed at homosexuals, immigrants, or the poor.
0|Yeah, you said the WAPO is crap, not the specific article, which is why I keep asking you - what puyblications do you most trust and referenbce?
0|I can't even tell if this is subtle parody or not.
0|And since democrats generally outnumber republicans (at least last I heard) if he draws mainly from independents it will mostly hurt the republican party.
0|They had complete legislative control.
0|does that mean that his infrastructure plan includes segregated drinking fountains?
0|Trump, Cruz, and Carson* Or at the very least, they wanted those candidates to force the other candidates to take on increasingly extreme positions.
1|No, obviously Hillary!
0|If he's trying to distract from the foreign donations to his campaign, he's going about it the wrong way
0|"It's a real struggle to both accurately depict their awfulness and remain ""civil""."

0|The guy should have just grabbed her in the pussy and you wouldn't object.
0|Trump's main platform is racism.
0|... If she was black or Hispanic
0|It's my biggest gripe with the left, they aren't fighters.
0|theres also black with a blue stripe horizontally in the middle.
0|The router thing and the nuclear power plant thing are both positions she has taken though, she thinks wifi waives cause brain damage (the autism was a joke about that) and she thinks nuclear power plants are sitting WMDs.
1|Yeah having to prove you're a citizen sucks.
0|But we are a republic so....she lost.
0|How is it huge or a mistake?
0|Shit, the Goldman speeches made me like her more.
1|Nazi Germany must have been some Jewish paradise, apparently they ran literally everything there
1|She also killed Scalia with a drone strike and personally orchestrated Benghazi!
0|Meanwhile, in reality, the idiot racist alt righters want to institute their own form of Sharia Law and are too fucking stupid to understand it.
1|Perhaps they don't show the overwhelming mastery of compromise demonstrated by the modern GOP, but progressives are working on it.
1|Here, you dropped this.
0|*Because of the implication* -Dennis Reynolds
1|Is that what we're calling prisons now?
0|What about that blow he's clearly into?
1|Not if they remarry
0|It's the odd adherence to the teachings of the old book... J man is in theory the closest interpreter of the Father.
0|That's okay his kids are going to save 100 of millions of dollars when he does away with the estate tax
0|I guess the truth hurts
0|He probably can't, because he knows that an independent manager would uncover dirt.
1|because being allowed to buy alcohol or drive is exactly the same as being allowed to vote...
0|We will see what happens, but one group of supporters is going to be surprised/pissed on November 9th, that's guaranteed.
0|Aren't the Clinton areas of the country the places where the riots are taking place?
0|Ann Coulter just tries to say provocative things to get attention because she knows she's an irrelevant waste of space.

0|Wasn't them who leaked that but ok.
0|why so salty
0|not all millennials are liberal
1|So... make America great again?
0|no news is 100% real, it's all editorialized to some extent
0|Or Bag of Holding?
0|The supreme court isn't the number one issue for everyone who would consider to vote for a left candidate, as we can see from the results.
0|I can't wait to see the mental gymnastics that some people will go through to excuse his lies and failed promises.
0|This explains why he went on that Twitter rant earlier about (again) how he could've won the popular vote too if he wanted to, and in fact it's more difficult to win the electoral vote (which makes zero sense).
0|Ayyy
1|So... NC didn't elect a governor over anti-LGBT law, but voted for a president and vp that are very anti-LGBT... totally makes sense
0|Stop crying the election is over.
1|Lizards don't cry.
0|Dude, delegates don't matter anymore.
1|And the first Native American!
1|Oh, well that makes it alright then.
0|Yes they need to re-legitimize it so in 3.5 years they can wield its power against Trump.
1|Nice way to perpetuate... keep it up... continue the disenfranchisement, that will surely help the next candidate
0|We doubted he would win too
0|You have a good brother.
0|Don't forget the Central Park Five
0|What if you have a strong alibi?
0|It is when the first count puts a reality TV star into the oval office.
1|all they know is that kanye supports trump, so he must be a terrible person
0|What do you base that off of and what is keeping you from examining the shift in the market since Trump's victory?
0|Yeah i know, it's sarcasm though.
0|I guess it's suddenly fucked up when **other** countries start doing that shit to their own people, but we can do it because we need law and order.
0|In left speak: geographical privilege
0|oooh ominous
0|~~Don't~~ Can't
0|he was insinuating that clinton wouldnt show up as delusional as that is lol.
1|Yeah, we can drop all that STEM stuff now.
0|He's not scoring points with anyone who didn't already support him..... The rest of us have memories that go back more than a week and won't assume trump is a nice guy off one tweet.
0|But you know .. he'll read boring poorly written reports from intelligence operatives
0|Know your enemy.
0|Republicans have a few voters who want to cheat, Dems have a presidential candidate who wants to cheat
0|"""Economic anxiety."""
0|You're advocating for heavily populated states to have the ultimate say in the federal government while the less populated states have zero say.
0|The problem is that Trump flip-flops too often for anyone to truly understand the difference between him actually changing his opinion, and him simply lying as a tactic.
0|"The ""business man"" just won an election on the back of promises of reopening the mines."
0|You mean we won the popular vote
0|Conservatives like Ted Cruz, Kasich, and John Roberts do.
1|I mean it's not like the other candidate had donations coming in from other countries at all.
1|You forgot the
0|But not the most electoral college votes.
1|But thank god we really showed it to the establishment by letting the embodiment of the establishment into office!
1|But but Democrats are just as bad as Republicans!
1|Well, at least he's draining his own swamp
0|How are they going to get coal mining jobs back when you cant extract any more coal from the place you extracted the coal, it doesn't make any sense.
0|Good, then failure cant be blamed on obstructionism!
1|Nice try, ISIS
0|Motive in obtaining the information does not change its neutrality.
0|if twitter bans the president of the united states, people should start buying facebook stock because it will explode as twitter tanks.
0|In the tweets he suddenly deleted on his account encouraging violence in reaction to any criticism or loss on his part.
1|If she has him adopted her next child could be a democrat.
0|I guess physics works differently for them.
1|Hey, I was wondering if he would ring up Ollie North.
1|He was with Steve Buscemi
0|Lets be clear, we are talking about treason here.
0|He was just listening to what major candidate for president Donald Trump said.
0|You watch, I bet there's going to be an Anti-Trump from the Left that rears his head in a few years.
1|Yeah,  imwithher clearly communicated a group, rather than personal goal.
0|There's a large web of video as well as wikileaks evidence supporting my claims.
1|Careful, you'll hurt their feelings and that's why Trump is president!
0|Paranormal experts who are full time plumbers!
1|Yeah we need to kill all the cows too so we can slow down global warming
0|"6 chambers out of 98 changed hands at state level, a net of 5 seats out of 435 switched in the house, 2 out of 34 seats changed in the senate , yet this year is still billed as a ""change election""."
0|No, you love the system, I can tell by looking at your logical incongruities and having seen quite a few systems in my time.
0|Hence heroin.
0|Why do you think a woman gets an abortion?
1|Yeah I'm sure the pollsters kept a list of Trump supporters and beat them up.
1|Yeah, fuck those white people, amirite?
0|CNN and Fox would love it ratings boost
1|butbutbut emails and BENGHAAAZIII
0|Okay but do you really believe it will just go away?
0|But... why didn't ya say Watership Down author Richard Adams?
0|There was a post from the_dingus where they actually believed that LeBron would endorse Trump
0|So giving speeches to rich people is inherently nefarious.
0|Trump supporters must really be gloating now that he's bucking the Republican establishment.
1|emails.
0|There was a lot more corruption going on than bad emails though.
1|THANKS, OBAMA!
1|You still don't get it, do you?
0|Help us electoral college, you're our only hope!
0|I think I just heard the House of Cards theme play in my head
0|I don't think I can trust polls anymore at this point
1|Yes, everything is a conspiracy.
0|They already did this year.
0|That would block off a lot of young people who haven't yet gotten/are currently working on their degrees
0|Make it worth it anyway, vote for down ticket berniecrats.
0|Obviously a new york billionaire that lives in a gilded tower with his name on it understands the part and parcel needs and struggles of the average rural blue collar worker in this country, right?
0|He photosynthesizes?
0|Enjoy the fascist dictatorship you voted for.
1|You're right, the mainstream media is very fair and unbiased.
1|Bannon is really a temporizing influence
0|"What about ""newz""?"
0|Good thing he knows how to cure it then.
0|Might be that something like the International Brigades is needed soon...
1|Gotta keep that class warfare going, am I right?
0|Take a chill pill and read your candidate's own words.
1|Concern trolling probably
1|but we have to listen to their concerns and points, no matter how nonsensical they happen to be.
1|Strengthening democracy and ensuring the will of the people?
1|"but ""some of my best friends are black!"""
1|It's not as crazy as using your personal email for work.
0|Because the tax break for working class people will be small, we're talking a tank of gas a month, and because the under-the-table jobs that illegal immigrants do are not a replacement for full time work with benefits.
0|What a bold new strategy!
1|But we saw his financial disclosures.
1|Yeah, but they are terrorizing Muslims... so no biggie.
1|I'm sure his abused ex-wife was just trying to spread bad rumors too.
1|A president not doing what they said while running.. SHOCKING
1|Making that anti-wall street bank!
0|Not with that attitude.
1|no man that whole cyber command branch of the armed forces/army is for keeping hostile memes out of america
0|That was the defense that Zimmerman used, though.
0|Yeah but if he had just been more patient he could have done it by tweeting.
0|Correct, FPTP is a garbage system that ensures a large proportion of the population is utterly ignored and unrepresented.
1|"""A man with arms isn't unarmed."""
1|Yeah stopping special interests from plowing through burial grounds and opening their only source of water up to destruction is masterbatory.
1|Weather has a clear liberal bias
0|Unfortunately we currently have congress setting the opposite precedent.
1|Yeah, 'cause why would black people want rights and freedoms, amirite?
1|SJW IDENTITY POLITICS SAME AS IF YOU PUT WHITE NOT RACIST MAGA YOU LOST
1|Votes for a woman are only worth 3/5ths.
1|I VOTED TRUMP!
1|Yeah but everyone knows trickle down economics works
0|Well, the laughing just got 10 dB louder...
1|Bad Obama policies.
0|The most concerning thing from this election cycle is not that Trump is going to be president, but that facts no longer matter.
1|Well then China... thanks for all the hard work at reducing emissions
0|What is their plan for the ridiculous scenario we are currently in?
0|"""Donald Trump is President"" ""Technically, not until January"" ""Look at all that denial"" ...I don't think you know what denial is"
1|It was rammed down our throats by having it passed by the House, Senate, Senate again, reconciliation process, signed into law by the president, and (mostly) approved by the Supreme Court!
1|Yeah, the worst kind of propaganda, to get kids to actually try and take care of the planet we have.
1|And let's not forget that other great precedent from one of Donald Trump's heroes who had jews wear stars of David on their clothing.
1|Hey, I think I know that guy!
1|That has not been confirmed by the Trump camp.
1|Thanks for clarifying that standard, family values guy.
0|Save time, eat land mines
1|He does have a point about cheap Wal Mart shit though -- it will be the same Wal Mart shit, but now more expensive.
1|Oh no, he WAS a lobbyist, he quit like, a week ago, so it's all good now.
0|Words only have power if you let them Words alone can't actually grab your pussy Don't be alone with Donald.
1|If he brought back detectives stabler and Logan I'd vote for him!
1|What about the ban-homework bill and the you-can't-ground-me amendment?
1|Yeah but at the same time Putin is making them hard
1|I'm sure wikileaks would publish them to get the truth out
1|You forgot the
0|He was being sarcastic.
1|Yeah you're right the white multi millionaire clinton family are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better.
0|What do you suggest we do to get rid of them?
1|Minorities can't be racist you silly privileged white person.
1|Just the poor kids, so that's ok.
1|Don't worry, Brietbart will clear things up I'm sure.
1|But they got rid of Soros !
0|Trying to extrapolate the behavior of an individual (me) onto an entire group (liberals)... That sounds about right...!
0|Well Trump did say he would make new battle ground states
0|"Because the Hamilton ""scandal"" is a more catchy headline"
0|Ha then why was this story up voted twice to the front with over 4,000 Ptah on  politics when they thought this was a trump supporter?
1|Good point.
0|"""The American people have spoken"""
1|"Voice of reason from ""WhiteDonaldTrump"" here"
0|He then put on his aviators and drove away in his camaro.
0|When you presume another's position, you are only arguing with your imagination.
1|well its about time.
1|Don't worry, raising minimum wage will not have the same effect.
1|I'm sure the African American community enjoys that position.
0|So you were only referring to the national polls and not any of the polls predicting a 98% chance of a Hillary win based on those polls, right?
1|Yep, the US will go back to its agrarian past, MAAA
1|With Google Facts^TM you never have to worry about fake news again!
1|But if Liberal media is as critical of the President as Conservative media has been for the last 8 years they're being biased and unfair!
1|A reputable newspaper obviously wouldn't say anything negative about our God Emperor.
0|But voting Johnson *doesn't* threaten the parties that are in control.
0|Interesting
1|Yeah because the birther thing is real
0|How dare she call white supremacists deplorable!
1|Now that group has less money to use to kill Americans - he was just being smart!
1|yeah saying deport illegal immigrants is the same thing as killing 6 million people
1|He's obviously strictly anti-human, it's just politics don't get so upset
0|no one is questioning upenn here
1|I'm glad to see the USA sticking to it's roots.
0|I think you mean Ed McMuffin
0|Trump would probably just say that makes Michigan smart.
0|The Trumpening.
0|Using imigrants as a threat... clever way to motivate the Right
0|But he's changed his mind once he entered the primaries, and now he's vehemently, and sincerely pro-life
0|Integrity Trump Pick one
1|it wont becuz taxation is theft so taxes r bad y does the government need taxes anyway screw the government
0|They actually ruled to turn it back down to a lower court, at which point Gore declined to pursue the case further
1|And then sexually assault the unicorn in a pizza joint and post it on instagram
0|And this time when it crashes completely the cash-less society will finally emerge and those banks will get a % cut of Every.Single.Transaction anywhere... line up to get your ID   hand tattoo.
1|Bc the outcome of the election would've definitely been identical in terms of vote count if the popular vote mattered
1|Everyone knows he replaced it with a bust of Stalin
0|It's going to be worse to like the millionth degree dude.
0|"""Kids say the darnedest things."""
1|Yeah, Trump is a hero for taking such a bold stand.
1|"God, ""alt-right"" is such a politically correct term"
0|While I highly disagree with Dick Cheney, the keyword in your comment is before.
0|Just another straw for the camel I guess.
1|If passed I'm sure this law would have no negative consequences
1|**definitely** sent by trump supporters!
0|What even is this article?
1|Someone's sounding awfully like a communist.
1|hooray for bypassing the primary process!
0|How?
1|Kind of like when Mexico sends their people, they're not sending their best?
1|Well he did need to copy off his wife's ballot.
1|Watch out Donnie, the Hillary Dream Team is coming to get you!
0|We can all dream.
1|You don't understand, Murica is a Christian nation founded on Jesus!
1|Sounds like a great way to lower unemployment
1|Just don't get sick and you'll have a fair deal then!
1|Yeah, but Hillary.
0|The terrorists have won.
0|Bernie voted with the dems essentially always; him not officially being a democrat shouldn't really be a big deal
0|Like small hands?
0|"""Lol it's all California so it doesn't matter xD"""
1|But, but, but, Soros is evil!
1|That sneaky socialist!
1|You saying combatting orders to report for duty doesn't count as real service?
1|Thanks Obama
0|Then you must really dislike this sub Reddit.
0|Then the DNC shouldn't have played dirty and screwed Bernie over like that.
1|That was spreading freedom to Chile, didn't you know?
1|"I didn't realize it was the trumpers who were all ""feelz before realz."""
1|California is manufacturing all the ballots it can.
1|I'm sure it's only because of all of those illegals who voted.
1|Thanks President Trump!
0|They need that blood spilled on the Temple Mount to bring about the Rapture.
1|I'm sure those employees who get to have Christmas with their children this year care a whole lot about what miss airhead has to say.
1|He's going to  drainthatswamp!
1|Oh but Hillary didn't *inspire* me
1|Because 5th graders have really informed opinions about presidential candidates
1|The wall of course!
0|Deflection and comparing are two different things.
1|It's not like science has ever done anything good for this country.
0|"Beyond that, it also just shows a blatant misunderstanding of what the word ""theory"" means in science..."
0|Well to be fair they were fighting and at war way before we ever came into it, we didn't help but they weren't on their way to being a first world or anything.
1|It's the Democrats' fault for not explaining it better.
1|This is better though.
0|So is Trump being president elect, but here we are.
1|Yeah but Trump is a blue collar billionaire
1|It would be patriotic, not socialistic.
1|But muh emails
0|This is usual United States' official policy: 'Investigatin'g means assulting a muslim eating pizza peacefully.
1|But I can say racist things and it's okay!
1|Well, I feel so much better now.
0|try 4chan
0|I got that, the point is trump doest pay any of his bills because he is a conman.
0|I mean the majority of educated people voted for Clinton, the left gets to at least claim intellectually higher ground
0|If you voted third party, then you gave your vote to Trump.
0|That would just increase divide among Democrats.
1|To be fair, what do they have to lose?
1|Yeah clearly all the news comes out because of this one example
1|Get rid of minimum wage and worker protections and we could have low cost Chinese style manufacturing sweatshops in America.
1|The Democrats invented technology and that took away your jobs!
1|Nah bruh, all you gotta do is cut some power lines!
1|Well he should've seen that coming and prepared for it!
0|It could be argued either way.
0|By the time of Comey's letter, you know the FBI had actually finished going through the new emails?
1|Everyone knows Trickle down economics fixed this issue.
1|Yeah, but if you have the 2nd you don't need to worry about the 1st.
1|BUT IT'S TOMATO KETCHUP
0|Wasn't there a recent news article of people getting arrested today for reading the Russian constitution out loud...on Constitution Day(in Russia)?
1|Look at that Trump bringing armed security jobs back to America.
0|"""The buck stops here"" - Harry S. Truman"
1|You're obviously delusional!
1|When they go low, we go lower, amiright?
1|...and I'm sure that Bernie is close to becoming the Democratic nominee.
1|TIL being 68 isn't old and being on blood thinners for the rest of your life due to cranial blood clots is perfectly healthy
0|This is what happens when you get conned...smh...hilarious how that man said 4 words and hoodwinked everyone...
1|But that's just the facts, can't trust those.
0|If the republicans put up single payer (truly single payer) I would vote R for a long time.
1|Hey man, reality tv is as America as it gets.
1|But his team won...
1|Why can't Democrats just accept that thousands of people are going to die from gun violence every year?
1|Yeah, I totally remember your caveat being applied to Clinton.
1|its not like clinton isn't a bullshit candidate and the entire reason trump won in the first place
0|Trump is a manifestation of Conservatism, whether Conservatives like him or not.
0|Videos of him boinking kids is what I think.
1|I heard he's sick
0|I'm nearly certain that thing with her dad is water under the bridge by now, and she has no desire to see America implode.
1|Yah the contents of the emails were barely discussed
1|Yes - but there were millions of uncounted votes that cost him the popular vote.
1|But he's building a wall, so we're good.
1|Well aren't you the expert on intelligence briefings
1|Commies, that's who!
0|I was actually suggesting coconuts migrate.
1|He's actually playing 17-D Chutes and Ladders and is using this to undermine Russia's influence.
1|You must be mistaken because Trump has said the notion that Russia was behind the DNC hacks was never mentioned until after the election.
1|You forgot the
1|he's a businessman!
1|It'll be interesting to see just exactly how he's gonna enforce that.
1|It's always pleasant to see would be dictators *always* announce their intentions before they do something.
0|Welcome to anywhere on the internet
1|Yeah but guns don't kill people, people kill people.
0|I would much rather see Trump dropped into Hellraiser
0|And then what
1|But Bernie can still win.
1|I don't know, it's the harmonica that sold me.
1|But he's under audit!
1|Sorry, I dropped this:
1|I am sure all the public schools are happy with his Secretary of Education pick...
1|Shhhhhhhhh we don't talk about that.
1|I mean, doctors used to think leeches were great for you, so how can we really trust them now when they say smoking causes cancer?
0|She also raped a guy, so....
0|"Us ""gun nuts"" don't like the idea of giving up our rights for the illusion of safety."
1|I mean, we haven't tried it yet so maybe it will work?
1|I've read about it on the internet so it must be true.
1|She won the popular vote still, so Russian clearly didn't do shit.
1|I wouldn't be satisfied until I had their social security numbers and was able to verify their identity by opening a credit card in their name.
1|You mean the mess *Obama* created.
1|Yeah, that's how they sucker you in....
1|I agree.... sexual consent it overrated.
1|Oh, as long as they interfered in the election out of friendship, then
1|History has proved harassment and threats work.
1|No, nothing to see here...
0|Is hyperbole the new language of 'murica?
0|So you're saying she still has a chance...
1|These measures are so in the public interest that we must do them in secret.
1|Climate change, gender rights, Muslims, if we could only get a list of people who just have different opinions we would be set.
0|Wow, so much falsity in one spot.
0|Why did they Photoshop trump over that picture where Hillary is embrasing the KKK
1|In other news, a Trump spokeswoman says that surprising the Dear Leader with an offer of breakfast fellatio is patriotic.
1|Yay, a big monopoly will save us.
1|If you take out the three million illegal votes, he won the popular vote!
0|Yeah basically.
1|But.... but what about Detroit?
0|Yeah and a lot of innocent people will probably be harmed in the process
1|Or wipe away all of the bad blood with a cloth?
0|They shouldnt have backed hillary yes but she still won the primary
1|Oh wow whatever shall we do!
1|Trump won the popular vote if you just exclude the votes for Hillary in California
1|So much small government
1|But he was an illegitimate president because he was born in Kenya so we can say whatever we want
1|Because Blackwater worked so well in Iraq
1|Such a reputable source
1|Why do you guys assume that he's a Republican?
0|While I agree, if they were 18 and 31, the age difference would be the same and it would be legal.
0|Pretty much anyone would have been preferable to Trump who hates the free press.
1|I heard they bit the heads off a dozen bald eagles and impaled the heads on burning flags
1|It's all discredited by its *anonymous* direct source that they can't name because someone will threaten their life.
0|2nd Amendment person here, not all of us are reactionaries, some of us are leftists and radicals.
0|So address the modern American nationalist movement.
1|I'm really sure the Republican Senate and House are going to hold inquiries as soon as possible...
1|But remember, the media that keeps propping this guy in front of a camera is full of liberal bias.
1|And castrate those that impregnated them!
1|Saying stuff like that is why Trump won.

0|Is that worth voting for a man who wants to explode the deficit and the national debt, make abortion a crime, do nothing to stop climate change, jail reporters he doesn't like, and make millions lose their jobs, perhaps even you, because of his trade policies?
1|I'm doing alright and it's not like it's *my* congressman that's the problem.
0|Can't it be both?
1|A lot of people are talking about it.
1|And absolutely no one was calling for her death before she said that.
1|I guess I'll go vote for Trump now
1|Isn't that what any reasonable person without brain damage would do?
0|That thing the Bible never expressly forbids and even encourages at one point, but that's still somehow the primary Christian political issue
0|Well, probably the definition is not black or white.
0|Well when the super wealthy keep siphoning every dollar they can from the lower and middle class, yeah it's not sustainable
1|Wow, these CTR talking points are getting pretty direct.
0|lol
1|You dropped your
0|"Depends on what the definition of ""very"" is."
1|Don't you know, you can't be unhealthy if you don't smoke or drink!
0|I never expected to see that food here
1|A leftist advocating for mass censorship, how surprising
1|After African American pandering week went so well
1|Wow the Clintons are suck dicks.
1|but Hillary told me Obama wasn't swayed by wall street money in all the debates!
1|You mean the foreign brands manufactured in the US, or the US brands manufactured in a foreign country?
1|Lucky for them they also always seem to be able avoid losing
1|In a completely fair and unbiased primary!
1|This joke implies that Democrats/left-leaning independents weren't interested in her non-contagious heat-flunomia photo-op campaign trail cancellation nothingburger, which, obviously, has been confirmed by the recent polling data.
1|Time to bend the knee everyone!
1|He was just being sarcastic
0|"Setting aside that neither you or Trump actually know what ""third world country"" means, I'd remind you that not only is our nation still strong, but it's also still recovering from last time we let a clueless, rich, Daddy's Boy into office."
1|Yet the military is woefully underfunded and we need to increase spending.
1|He works in Hollywood, that's close enough, right?
1|Oh yeah totally presidential of him.
1|That this country is half ungrateful, children and communists that want a handout and the other half is uneducated, white-supremacists that are too stupid to vote for their own interests.
1|Noble prize is rigged
1|No hate speech pls
1|im sure you're a hit with the ladies with that attitude
1|Yeah, the man who is literally talking about putting family members in his cabinet is absolutely above such trivial things.
1|So they aren't great if you are going left!
1|That would happen without loss of life for sure.
1|It just is, now pay reparations you white devils!
1|But blacks are not a race!
0|Are you kidding me some martian people don't have names
0|Clinton, by a fucking landslide.
1|Well, there was no need for racism until a black person got elected and ruined America just like black people ruin everything.
1|in other news, scientists all agree that before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, there was no moon.
1|I don't understand...why aren't you people pulling yourself up by your bootstraps?
0|I dunno, I guess you could ask him, except he's dead :( and a gorilla...
0|Why doesn't Clinton just do it?
1|But how can a fantastic business man not be admired by his peers?
1|But that doesn't fulfill my desire to reduce complex geopolitical tensions to soundbites, so Clinton is totally going to nuke Moscow.
1|Yeah racism is well-known to be reduced as people get older...
0|I am not white nationalist, just Nationalist.
1|But she cares about us
1|Never thought of it like that good point.
1|I'm sure THIS will finally be the one that does it.
1|Yeah, the candidate who's talking about the large number of prejudiced and irrational voters, an observation that's been well supported by polling and anecdotal evidence over the last year and a half, is sticking her head in the sand
1|My AR-15 whispers too me, demanding the blood of the innocent!
1|Because you aren't smart like trump
1|The USA should just follow NK's example and ban sarcasm
1|That's just like, your opinion man, opinions cannot be wrong.
1|Fuck it, let's start a war over my hurt feelings
1|He who smelt it...
1|You mean the 28th?
1|All the polls said Trump won.
0|It was a joke designed to let Hillary Clinton walk after committing treason.
1|Yeah I mean it's not like it's really easy to do something like call at around six o'clock when most people are home Your analysis also does a good job of explaining why hillary is ahead in most polls
1|Yeah, not like anything has changed that would merit evolving positions
0|Dat NBC relationship still going strong.
1|Hey, Trump made a real sacrifice when he decided not to talk about Bill's infidelities.
1|Yeah because Congress loves working with Obama.
1|Oh yeah the TPP is so liberal.
1|But he's smart and is a good business man for exploiting business strategies.
1|Not
1|Forgot the
1|Isn't it great that we have such top quality front runners
1|Alrighty, if CNN does it then Trump doing it should be no problem
1|Good point, 'cause he's proven time and time again that he's so open to the ideas and opinions of others.
1|15 day old account with a name referencing something anti-Clinton, sounds like a true Bernie Supporter.
1|Debate rigged, moderator biased, questions unfair, mic broken, sniffles fabricated, too courageous to bring up Bill's affairs, and yet he still won.
1|But they didn't intend to break the law.
0|It makes you wonder if after Obama leaves office if they will continue blaming things on him into future presidential terms.
0|That's what I do with all of my raises, just siphon the difference to my narcotics budget.
1|Yeah but Hillary is so unlikable and has scandals too, so equivalence.
1|Maybe they just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
0|To be fair, I doubt he knows a single Merkel's policy.
1|WRONG, only Trump gets taken out of context by the biased liberal media
0|Well... I'll two out of the three.
0|Nah pretty sure they do.
1|Unnamed sources are the best sources.
1|Also undeniable that he's a Muslim from Kenya
1|No, they were going to get Assange when he took one of his weekly brunch trips to Pakistan
1|Oh, just what we needed!
0|when Al Gore tells you that your vote counts it carries some weight
1|Yea, how dare their people vote against marijuana when it's so good for them!
1|"""Why not?"""
1|But Hillary is the elitist.
1|A vote for Stein is a vote for Trump though
0|More like a truckload.
1|Are you questioning the integrity of USAPOLITICSNOW?
1|Or a state like Pennsylvania, which he can only lose if it's rigged.
1|Surely these optics will help with his dwindling AA vote share
1|Pfft, what a nerd, everybody knows that crazy ramblings are the way to answer questions in a presidential debate.
1|This is nothing more than a distraction
1|But I can point to a few times where a woman made up rape so that totally proves all rapes are fake
1|See, Trump is not so bad.
0|In case anyone was wondering, prostitution isn't legal in Douglas County, NV...where the alleged incident took place.
1|Like Utah?
1|Well, obviously you are underestimating the power of Pepe memes on the general voting public.
1|Because we all know the truth that because Bill is the man and he's the one who's really in charge.
1|It's been proven that coin tosses have a liberal bias.
1|Yes, canadians flee en masse to accrue massive amounts of debt.
0|Quite a difference between 'not making money' as you put it, and losing ~$1billion
0|You do understand the federal deficit has shrank every year since Obama has been in office and is lower then the day Bush left?
0|The day before the final debate would be the opportune time to release it.
1|what a bitch, thinking that parents may care about issues affecting their kids.
1|Hey, you forgot this:
1|I think you mean the devil herself.
1|Or some bitch who already kidnapped 3 kids is getting a 4th for free
1|Yeah, I'm sure he'll do just that.
0|Or praise dictators like Vladamir Putin and scum of the earth like former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.
1|Yeah, Haiti did alright.
1|Oh, but he's such a good Republican, and so pro life!
0|A good ol' soma holiday.
1|You forgot this:
0|The Republicans sowed the seeds of hatred that spawned nominee Trump, not Obama.
1|Well - infant mortality in Texas is rising because they cut funding to a bunch of family planning programs... But at least Planned Parenthood isn't getting state money to provide Pap smears and HIV testing to poor people!
0|Well since Hillary is not a war-mongerer and she has made a very serious commitment to battling climate change, I assume you're voting for her?
1|We are making America great again!
1|Yes and it was the Socialists that burned down the reichstag
1|But some people game the system, surely that's reason enough to discard our entire economy for some vaguely defined alternative
1|Yeah I'm sure Trump tanking our economy or our reputation internationally would definitely not affect you at all
0|Putin's cuck.
0|You lost
1|THOSE DAMN LIBERALS!
1|I see you've been brainwashed by the lamestream media.
1|They would have to stop raping and murdering people to make up a hoax
1|Maybe 'the media' is just not reporting the proof of innocence
1|"Why won't the GOP say ""Radical Christian Terrorism?"""
1|There you go again with the antisemitism again...
0|Then President Kaine will be.
0|Put a dollar in the fam jar.
0|You can start with not using gmails...
0|Maybe Trump meant that Lester Holt *looks* Democrat.
0|Good luck with that.
0|They would if they never thought they would get caught
0|I really hope you Trymp supporters act crazy enough on Election Day to get yourselves shot.
0|But this much irony would weigh too much and cause a rip in the time space continuum
0|Are you claiming that the African Americans are removing themselves from the voter registration lists?
0|This has literally never happened in the United States.
0|Whatever your thoughts on Trump are, I don't believe or trust a damn thing China says
0|Projecting.
1|"3 more about Benghazi and the 7th for being ""literally Satan"""
0|America already has a few questions.
0|I think this election is already done.
0|She has totally checked out and can't wait for this shit show to end.
0|"No, conservative states refusing the medicaid expansion and also refusing to pass minor changes needed to fix a few problems with the law is ""one of the worst things"""
0|Well she clearly didn't deny it, which is essentially the same argument wielded frequently against both candidates this election.
0|Damn and I thought Clinton suporters were suposed to be the ones melting down this week.
1|Hey the pope never let a U2 pilot get shot down
0|Listen to Bernie, vote for Hillary.
0|It won't even be mentioned in the history books.
0|They are already showing red on polls plus.
1|Oh wow, this is surprising on so many levels.
0|He's citing over three times the amount Obama has deported actually if my recollection is right...
1|You forgot
1|Just as the founders intended
0|I disagree - we should also be looking to see if there is evidence that this affected the outcome and evidence of complicity by any Americans in this subversion
0|Because If you are worse off then you are no one.
0|Building a party from the local level up is too much effort for her.
0|Because the private companies are magically more efficient, duh.
0|Hey you leave Call Of Duty players out of this.
0|A moment of silence for the interns who live in a timeline that is even more fucked up than ours.
0|Clinton Benghazi emails emails.
0|That's you not understanding how probability works.
0|Triggered
0|He just looks like a chicken fucker
0|I'd switch the Senate to a national party list vote in a goddamn heartbeat.
0|"""Leader"""
0|If he really thought that, he would not have tapped Sessions
0|Oh look a trump supporter
0|Nuclear war because Trump doesn't like the President of China's face would be bad.
0|Wow it's only like it is what actually happened and why the FBI is on Hillary's ass right now.
1|Oh well that's OK then
0|If he has nothing there will be a resignation.
0|Third world countries!
1|NO NO Go to the top of  politics you can see that he is a russian SPY...
0|No shit RNC.
0|The GOP ceased to be the Party of Lincoln years ago.
0|Born with a diamond spoon in his mouth and some how cares about the every day person
0|It's like Manchurian Candidate.
0|They don't believe in euthanasia though
0|So if people can get put on a list for urinating in public, why can't this guy get on a list for showing his ass to a inanimate object?
0|How long until Trump says something that Gloria can use against him?
0|Because maybe shit like this can be prevented for the next election?
0|Why didn't Trump raise his hand?
1|Glad to see the minority out reach is on fire with the GOP!
0|If these spineless voters exist, Trump doesn't want their low energy anyway.
0|Just cleaning a potential voters' teeth, thank you.
1|Yah because there is clearly no history of white racist burning black churches in the south.
0|I fail to see what a fictional Nazi Hunter has to do with anything.
1|You know, I wasn't going to vote for Trump, but this completely changed my mind!
0|Leave the lights on for us, K?
0|Fake news, and conspiracy sites only needs a few audience members with the following qualities to create a disaster * Gullibility * Prone to violence * Owns guns
0|Just so.
0|Bribes are the only debts a grifter will actually pay.
0|Pretty sure it was a joke.
0|Nah I think it is because can't be their sugar daddy
0|But one is much, much shittier than the other.
0|it's true... I mean, before Trump Tower was built in Manhattan, who'd even heard of NYC?
0|"Actually, the word ""resisting"" appears no where in the article's title, unless the title was changed by the source after it was posted."
1|No, because Google is American, and it's ok for an American organization to try to influence the American election.
1|No it's that shes white and old, you need a young, half black half latino lesbian
0|I wonder if he read about this in a newspaper, in his intelligence briefing, or heard about it from Pence?
0|God why doesn't this sub have an account age/karma requirement?
0|Donald Trump doesn't need this to lose the election, he already has.
0|But Hillary is a woman so checkmate.
0|Upvote to show how desperate the Russians are?
0|Ok, where's it show her being grossly negligent?
1|But why didn't she come forward sooner?
1|Yeah, the draft dodging pussy who spits on *real* veterans is a patriot.
1|Socialism is awesome!
0|A failing jewel: it doesn't shine as bright as it used to, but it can still cut like nothing else.
0|He sounds in over his head.
0|No shit Sherlock
0|*shakes head*
0|Most people just come back with some tequila, mezcal, or veladoras and the like, but whatever floats your boat I guess.
1|You know... riggers and rigger-lovers.
0|Less of a difference than the Trump is literally Hitler bullshit that is peddled.
1|Maybe Hillary can team up with Melania to help fight it!
0|Panic, run around in ever decreasing circles until you fall over, then repeat.
1|This just shows how good he is at business
0|Trump's or clinton's?
0|"AKA ""I had a good feeling on this one, bert"""
0|I feel like a kid caught smoking a cigarette, and the parent makes the kid smoke the whole pack.
1|But my marriage means absolutely nothing if government doesn't legally say so!
1|Yes, but they didn't sufficiently hurt the poor.
0|Because he didn't do it obviously and no one wants to mess with that shit even if everyone hates him.
1|but brah, he's talking about the ILLEGALS
1|Nah man, random internet comments are way more reliable than articles.
0|"""The election is rigged!"""
0|Low energy, sad
0|Yeah not for being a russian troll posting made up news from a fake website.
0|Ahh the good old I'll vote for the miserable candidate because the other one is awful..
1|No remember that was Russian hackers interfering in our election
0|To be fair, that's Trump's general MO.
0|Ha.
0|It will peter out like a damp fart as a new controversy distracts us.
1|I think you dropped this:
0|Too bad she's now a criminal and even more disqualified than before
0|As if he would be in a phone book like the serfs....
0|At  the_donald, black people who vote for HRC are the real racists!
0|You need a civics lesson.
0|Swing and a miss...
0|lol no
0|Ironic when you consider Clinton's upbringing and current status.
0|"I believe his defense at least once was along the lines of: ""you can't rape your wife."""
0|He *felt* like he was doing the right thing.
0|Yeah, the Republican representatives are so against Trump that they've come out in droves saying Bannon should be fired... oh wait.
0|Cheers to the Interstate and the Internet!
0|Some of them, I assume, will be taken aback by what the country has become.
1|I'm sure he's going to be 100% honest once he gets into office though.
0|You're forgetting that Hillary is not black.
1|Exactly, {{{Rudy Giuliani}}} is mafioso, we did it reddit.
1|Solution don't let conservatives vote!
1|Yeah, I am sure having a greedy asshole show up at an event will help these kids.
0|She probably just doesn't want anyone digging into her immigration records again.
0|if she had released them they would have just moved the goalposts further, there is no winning when they demand more and more and more because they've already made up their minds
0|Preview of Wednesday folks!
0|Yes.
0|That's where I heard it too, but I didn't stay to hear if they had ID'd the guy
0|Reality being the dozens of polls giving Hillary 90%+?
1|On the other hand he is the healthiest man to ever be nominated to the presidency.
0|Hasn't McConnell been in the Senate for decades before Obama even came along and yet he wants to blame the guy who's only been in DC 10 years?
0|They use the Freedom of Information Act to sue for documents they can use against Democrats.
1|I think he forgot
0|no
0|If you don't vote at every opportunity, you won't be heard.
0|Can Obama withdraw his nomination?
0|Like when the republicans killed the Zika bill?
1|Yea but that's actual music, not this rap crap
0|Killbot feltway outsider chill
0|Bill Clinton.
0|Not the ones on my fb feed.
0|There's a difference between buzzfeed and buzzfeed News
0|Where in Tennessee do you live?
0|Does this go over her parents extremism?
0|Remember that time when Rudy Giuliani publicly admitted to infidelity?
0|Never said he does, but I bet he represents you more than a team full of the GOP.
1|Yeah Klansmen are usually so secretive and subtle about their actions...
1|I wonder how many people would have died if he hadn't had a gun... Gee, come to think of it, I bet it would have been the same.
0|I censor corporations every day by changing the channel and turning things off.
0|That would most likely hurt Democrats, as absentee ballots are notorious for people forgetting to send them in.
0|you forgot russian operative.
0|This feels so wrong... but i upvoted it too.
0|...and their families.
0|Ah, I misread that as LARP at first and was very confused.
0|Travel on the roads in Southern California could be a day long event
0|jokes on him...DC always was a marsh and has never been swampland!
0|agreed...I didn't know where he was going with it at first but once he landed the punchline I burst out laughing.
0|It's amazing how people will latch onto this one moment, as if it's somehow more significant and damning than anything else being discussed about the various candidates in this election.
1|lol, the media has always been controlled by (((those with a liberal bias)))
0|Most of us have been so gerrymandered though, our votes are basically thrown away.
0|Didn't Trump say he bribed polticians in one of his first speeches?
0|If anything I wish Bill Hicks was around to see this mess so we could hear what he has to say
0|The later being an indication of the former.
0|Still deflecting to Hillary?
0|I understand what you meant
1|The monsters
0|If she weren't his daughter perhaps he'd be dating her.
1|Of course Glenn does, where else is he going to score all that ~~cocaine~~ outrage fuel?
0|wow.
0|That's because his supporters will do it for free.
0|Trump has done infinitely more towards that end than Salon ever could.
0|Yes, if he loses the vote.
0|So, we have a clear impeachable offense before he even takes office.
1|Clinton pushed him in assuming.
0|Better then Bannon kind of relieved.
1|You can't fool me, you're just using facts to further your liberal agenda.
0|Bill Cosby raped less women.
0|Its probably time to change their name to TrumpChumps They were warned...
1|let me guess... she's voting for trump isn't she?
0|Question: Can the senate filibuster on the vote to remove the filibuster from the SCOTUS vote?
0|She's saying Donald didn't help essentially.
1|that's because a Clinton victory is riggedly probable
0|Do we have numbers yet on what percentage of his supporters don't see anything wrong with serial sexual assaults?
0|Caprese Salad
0|You aren't gonna give anyone gold
0|I mean I don't blame him for avoiding the press
1|He'd be ideal as Trump's Secretary of State, they'd work together beautifully !
0|Would have loved to see the landslide if they did know about registering early.
0|Well at least this will kill majority of his twitter bot followers.
0|Maybe in the Midwest but not the South... you're not the entirety of the right-wing, redditor
0|But...let's pretend!
0|Clearly if they use his own words they will have crossed the line of decency.
0|Not exactly... I am!
0|The full meaning of this rebellion and mandate in every branch has not filtered through yet, I see.
1|Putin got the election he paid his 1337 hax0r team for.
1|Because Trump understands the cost of his actions
0|For me the biggest worry point was HRC's rallies the days before the election: they reminded me a lot of what John Kerry did in the final days of his campaign.
0|This is what happens when you are simple minded and read nothing but left wing rag sites...
0|She lied so much herself though.
1|It's because college educated white women are sexist bernie bros.
0|The Art of Deflection: How I Almost Made Trump Palatable.
1|Glad black people have an ally in progressives
1|If the shoes were reversed I am sure it would've been received much better.
0|Yeah, me neither.
1|Yeah, because Texas leaving would be so great for the US economy.
0|You live in a fantasy world.
0|Isn't black lives matter officially opposed to body cams?
0|Taking a couple hours out of your day once a year to support the service members is garbage?
0|They were fresh out of Papyrus.
0|Cons have come full circle.
0|He should also take intelligence seriously, remember that warning about 9/11 attacks issued in early August?
0|Never been rooting for a coup this hard before.
0|It would also tank the United States' economy.
0|How about when he said Barron is great at the cyber?
0|I always assumed Dubya would hold that distinction forever, but it turns out I was exponential magnitudes of wrong.
1|It would be nice if we had an example of a recent Republican president enacting a very similar economic plan, only for it to fail miserably.
0|Only that Sanders actually tries to help out the common man, to where the Tea Party obstructs the government from functioning because they don't like leftward policies.
1|yes what if your not even born legally?
0|Your stupid words don't undo the actions of muslims.
0|What about kanye west?
1|But it makes you know who to vote for, thats the one thing its good for
0|What's up is you never accepted by bet because you are a coward.
0|Why would people support him after he endorsed Hillary
0|Which of HRC ideas are you opposed to as they compare to Bernie's and Trump's...?
1|Never would have expected hypocrisy from Trump.
1|Well yeah but there is less money in *my* bank account.
0|They probably don't want to talk to you either
0|I wonder how many people Trump has had murdered?
1|I'm sure the subreddit that called him Daddy Trump are going to be critical of his missteps.
0|Yeah, he just cut out the middle man and picked the people funding the corrupt politicians.
0|Wasn't childish but justified.
0|On the bright side, I can now tell my pro-Trump friends that Donald Trump thinks the founder of ISIS is a great man.
0|Wow never thought I'd see a *Hillary Clinton* supporter complain about lack of media coverage.
0|Hillary wasn't in office for DOMA and Iraq wasn't completely unpopular in 2002.
0|Okay they can fuck right off.
0|If only Trump had moved on him earlier.
1|The biggest show of decency and grace, too
0|Yeah main thing I hate is that every time there's a liberal protest it's supposedly bought and paid for, and I'm sure there is some financing of the more organized protests but it's not like everyone out there has an extra hundred in their pockets.
0|And all of the Socialism.
1|Pretty sure the Constitution is only composed of the 2nd amendment, the 10th amendment, and the King James version of the Holy Bible.
0|"I met a guy recently who came across a ""Trump Pence"" sign that was modified so it read ""Trump Putin"""
1|Maybe it's a hoax.
0|So you cant answer the question?
1|No, you just think that she's boring because of systemic sexism.
0|How about let's also not ignore the fact that the post-1960s Democratic party is not and should not be the same as the pre-1960s Democrats.
0|To give context, the families targeted in this letter are families with adopted children of different races, they suspect it was sent from a parent with children in the same swim club as their children.
0|"""Trumpcare"" sounds.... disgusting...."
0|I'm willing to take you seriously, and it's November 11th.
1|They have the people in mind, not their business....
1|He doesn't need to since he's going to be so anti-intervention.
1|These ads against Trump are **NOT NICE**.
1|Christian charter schools with corporal punishment will make America great again.
0|He's going off the rails on the crazy train!
0|So why is trump saying he's going to immediately deport 3 million people?
1|Oh god the article doesn't even say that the Russian government is behind the hacks, this author must really think he's a brave American standing up to those dang Russians.
1|Yep, nothing but risotto recipes.
1|Yes, completely reasonable assumption there.
1|I'm sure if we just give Putin the Sudetenland he will be happy.
0|Speaking as a Sanders supporter who valued the honesty and candor he brought to our political discourse, I think this is one of the best things she's said this whole campaign
1|Yeah I mean it's totally better to be a bunch of ignorant sheeple who are stupid enough to think that the establishment government has their best interests in mind and would never, ever do something so crooked as rig an election or try to cover up crimes
1|Yeah I'm sure that Putin wasn't chuckling in the background or anything
0|It would still be less expensive than supporting their entire family.
0|This would place her at the top of a list of losers.
0|I'm already tired of losing
0|Weird I don't remember saying that.
0|Glad to hear you enthusiastically accept both Hillary or trump a president
0|No mustache?
0|Your point being?
1|We could have totally avoided that with Hillary
0|I think that is why, I know that is why.
1|Man, the economic anxiety must be pretty bad for this lady.
0|I will fucking die laughing if he goes to jail over this after the display he put on at the RNC.
0|Looks like Bernie bends the knee
1|no they're just sellouts
0|Maybe the laws in place or the process of getting citizen ship should change instead, its alot easier than physically deporting 3 million people.
0|I could actually see that working
1|Giving power to anti-Semites has sure never caused any problems before
1|Not if you put them in tents surrounded by barbwire and machine guns.
1|Oh no I'm scared!
0|Look at every time it's been used, and it becomes clear that it has only empowered them.

0|Wait, aren't these the guys who want to MAGA?
1|Bought and paid for by Russia, of course.
1|Like negative 1 million is bad right?

0|You say tomato tomato, I say tomato tomato
0|You might think that, I couldn't possibly comment.
1|oh yea just like we megathread every little thing trump says on this subreddit, right.

1|Ah yes, because there's nothing that women these days like more than some good old-fashioned victim blaming.
1|Pfft since when does a president need to know anything about foreign countries anyway?

1|Oh, you believe Soros actually exists?
0|He'll bring jobs back the same way he brought back his casinos!
0|No I am sure MizzouRah22 is just not a racist homophobic bigot that is triggered by a comedy show.
0|"Hillary is many things, but ""incompetent"" is *not* one of them."
1|This justified the vote for all of those hardcore conservatives out there.
1|Maybe each voter could split into its own micro state, and everyone gets one vote.
1|look how well that worked.
1|Nah the election is only for the president
1|Those are all good points but I heard that Hillary said a mean thing in an email and we absolutely can't have that.
1|This is a nice change from the other guy who campaigned on lowering DNC voter turnout.
1|That didn't look like anything to me.
0|"I am waiting for the ""look at her"" comments at rallies and ""look at her sex tapes"" at 3 am."

1|Sounds like she needs to pull herself up by her bootstraps.
0|Man I don't know what you did, but they are hating you for this.
1|Actually you're wrong and all white people voted for trump and are racist fucks.
0|If he hates Jews and other minorities then please post some direct quotes from him that proves this.
1|Good thing the popular vote is how we elect the president
1|Oh boy, I can't wait for Democrats to nominate Hilary in 2020
1|You seem like a reasonable, informed person.
1|You dropped this
1|Well Trump did say he was going to get crime out of the inner cities and stop illegals from coming here, so I guess that's one way to do it.
0|What's mildly infuriating is you people not realizing that we know this and want to change this.
0|How dare she try to help people with hiv
1|yeah we should get the government to tell businesses who they should and shouldn't do business with
0|quick, hack his emails!
1|You dropped this
0|Trump is too dumb for a great deal of things.
1|Well they have billions so maybe I'll get millions if they are in office
0|I know, but this is our time to show that we are better than them, but instead, we stoop lower.

0|No, he is not president.
0|She's been consistently in favor of universal health care for more than 20 years, since at least when Bill Clinton was president.
0|Do you see the irony of wanting to laugh at Stein, given the record amount of absurdity that has come out of Trump's mouth on nearly everything?

0|Seriously, these people almost had to buy it or worry about their jobs.
0|Exactly, it's a matter of consistency :) kidding, if anything he could use being less PC about many other things too.
0|When your 100,000 people are spread across 150 miles as opposed to maybe 20 miles, obviously the increased density will lead to higher crime rates.
1|Yeah, it's pretty ill-considered to put a financially successful person in charge of a major finance function in your cabinet...
1|Well, at least this time she voted for the party of personal and fiscal responsibility, so she must be getting her act together.
0|...isn't that technically a conflict of interest?
1|Yeah you probably pray to win the lottery

0|I still don't get why you are suggesting Democrats don't love their country
1|Well that changes everything
1|Yeah, she was really posing as a Republican with her repeated statements on making the rich 'pay their fair share' and expanding social+healthcare services
0|Ah, the ramblings of a buffoon.
0|pretty sure trump ran on bringing back manufacturing jobs to the rust belt and thats how he swayed a few swing states.
1|Projection isn't even a real thing
0|He's gunna go after her like a bitch
0|I respectfully disagree.
1|Yeah but those jobs are from where stupid liberals live so they don't matter
1|yeah but Hillary would have been just as bad
0|A presidential candidate who has already called on a hostile foreign power's intelligence service to hack his opponent for information, and who may only owe his financial well being to cash infusions from that country, is DEFINITELY a problem for me.

0|I think it's unlikely considering the demographics of the minorities in those regions; blacks fled from the south continuously from during the 19th and 20th centuries, and economically the south has nothing to offer a region centered on Chicago.

1|Hackers only wanted his pasta recipe didn't you know
1|Yes please DNC Democrats give us another Hillary that's what we need!
0|Sorry for being out of the loop, but what is on Friday?
1|Trump - refuses to recuse his family who are running his business empire from presidential business Obama - refuses to recuse his blackness from presidential business See, they're both the same!
1|They will never have enough evidence to prove that it was intentional coordination...The bar is too high and Trump had a fever the day of that telephone conversation, so he can't be held responsible for misunderstanding what was going on...
1|Yeah, cus those blue states are really in the green.
0|I won't paint all Trump voters with the same brush, but anyone who did this is an idiot.
0|Go there if you want to seig heil your new glorious leader.
0|Da

0|Dude is the poster child for that sub lol.
1|Obama IS one letter away from Osama!
1|Yes, we're more qualified than CIA agents when it comes to things that might look bad for our God-emperor
1|But Obama is the reason I'm poor and Trump is going to turn this country around!
1|But those poor people in that underdeveloped country need our aid!
0|An Astonishing 99% of Democrats incorrectly believe the United States elects through popular vote not electoral college.
1|Sounds like the perfect person to elect as President.
1|No Hillary kills people.
1|Because that's so much worse than a Russian oligarchy.
0|No
1|Hmm...I wonder why?
0|Trump has no ideology other than self-preservation and self-promotion taken to an obscene extreme.
1|Not his first choice, amirite folks?
1|You forgot your
0|The EC was implemented to prevent a monarchy from emerging.
0|Besides it never happened?
1|Uhm... how'd he get that approved in DTS?
1|At this point, what difference does it make?
1|But Hillary would've been just as bad!
1|The market will take care of this!
0|But hey Baron 'Cyber' Trump and Melania at least don't have to slum it up in the White House like every other First Family!
0|I'd say Russian dressing
1|Good thing we have an electoral college to make sure a demagogic populist doesn't become President.
0|Except he doesn't drink, and if he did I feel like he'd be the type who only drank beer brewed from hops that have been regurgitated by jungle cats out of hollowed out gold plated elephant tusks....or Natty light.
1|Because the other side played fair the entire election
1|What a rational comment...
0|A social conservative libertarian is an oxymoron.

1|Yeah, because the right never insults anyone with a different opinion and Trump has the highest morals and would never do such a thing, ever.
0|Or god is a racist.
0|The important ones are in his administration.
1|true, Russia has completely changed theyre now a country that prioritizes individual liberties.
0|and I suspect that, while they do lie regularly, most aren't quite so blatant about it, nor get such a free pass from their supporters when caught out.
1|Yeah, it's like to add or not to add
1|Totally the same thing!
1|But why not, she won the popular vote
1|Pff there's no profit in that

1|Because taxes are the devil
1|Some consolation... your congress is doing a stellar job
0|How can any doctor know that anybody is fit to be president?
1|Yup, because no way someone would start a charity for any other reason than to make some money, right?
0|Fuck Morning Joe
1|Well shit no good counter argument to that, because of that insightful comment I will now be voting for Donald J. Trump!
1|Well obviously a Hillary shill then

1|He sure cares a lot about women's rights for a Muslim.
0|Alt-right isn't a race.
0|How do you know the election is rigged?
0|You can see in Goodman's reporting they break through and a protestor is tackled by a guard.
1|It's not like Trump has lied or changed his views or positions about anything right
0|too bad it didn't apply to Nixon'sVP Spiro Agnew who ultimately left office and paid fines to avoid prosecution for bribery and tax evasion.
1|Brietbart hasn't had an article on it so I don't believe you.

1|Can someone clarify if this qualifies as deplorable?
1|Your friend sounds like the picture of health

1|Did you forget the
1|If only Obama would budge a little bit by banning abortions, outlawing Obamacare, impeaching himself, and jailing Hillary we wouldn't be having these problems.
1|I'm sure people are changing their vote because of how the Clinton campaign views a cartoon frog.
1|Don't be so thin skinned.
1|I support a national database of Trump supporters
0|Lol...If it was anybody but trump maybe but the fact is Trump needed a warm body to fail with.
1|Yes, I'm sure that this movie is going to be a very fair and balance portrayal of what happened.
1|All right... all right... but apart from the supreme court and abortion rights and climate change and the economy and a path to citizenship and trade wars and citizen's united and student loans... what Clinton policies do you even support?
1|"But the flair says ""No Satire""!"
1|No, you don't get it, she should have known what would happen!
0|I've been reporting every one of them as spam.
0|It's a bit worrying that Trump came out on top in the Commander-in-Chief forum, hopefully Hillary's health holds up for the debates.
0|On the plus side, you don't live in Wisconsin anymore, hopefully you went somewhere warmer?
0|The real reason to say it's dying is that it does very poorly among millenials and the baby boomers are rapidly aging.

0|Good luck with that one.

0|Also it was rigged, so there's that...
1|I bet he even has Mexican ancestry so he can't be fair to Trump.
0|Its almost like most college aged males(reddit demographic) think trumps a mess... But no its all correcttherecords fault lmao

1|Nah man, everyone should consider it their civic duty to give as much money in taxes to the government as possible.
0|If you'd read the article, you'd see the questions in the leading paragraph.

1|I wonder why?
1|He hasn't even started on her yet.
1|Maybe that explains why most people don't plan for a retirement!
0|Completely agree, but after spending time in this echo chamber, it's pretty clear that Clinton supporters need to be reminded of this.
0|lol This is what desperation looks like so how about that Jerk Tim Kaine?
1|yeah but the new York times is owned by a mexican
1|Because evil liberals are keeping them down by giving all their tax money to minorities and immigrants
1|Cause Howard Stern lies all the time
1|But Hillary had some meetings with some of the Clinton Foundation donors, so they're both the same!
1|So, you have no government where you live?
0|...because there is more coming, Assange stated in his video conference this morning that at least some data will be leaked each week for the next 10 weeks.

1|Oh, I'm sure the shills and rigging and corruption stops at the DNC only, no way it goes deeper
0|Technically it was a surrogate iirc
1|Hillary is already in prison because of benghazi, that is why she has no press conferences.
1|Agreed, they're bringing in race, they're racists, they're divisive, and *some* I *assume* are OK people.
0|Well he raped his ex wife so...yeah sounds about right.
1|"These got ""leaked"": 1. on a friday night 2. after hillary already beat bernie 3. directly following a bombshell 2005 clip of trump trashing women gets dropped yeah I'm sure the clinton campaign are in total panic mode and totally didn't leak this themselves"
0|I just want this campaign to be over.
1|you forgot
0|Because when the entire power of the government is brought to bear agsinst a single individual, even the worst individual, somebody has to stand up next to them and make sure the government follows the rules.
1|They might be jealous of how he is one of the healthiest people to ever run for president.
0|They probably don't know any.
1|But remember, Hillary learned her lesson on voting for Iraq.
1|What a gentleman.
0|Because they're not allowed to bring in their own cameras to keep people from taking photos during the debate, the disposables are provided for them.
1|You forgot the
1|I think the one who takes pride in Patriots beating Browns is pretty racist, you deplorable.
1|Based soley on the facts of course.
1|Oh come on guys, it's just a little locker room assault
1|yep the entire system is rigged and thats the only way a non guilty person can be found not guilty
1|"C""mon, anonymous internet comments originating from Russia &amp; the mentally ill have the same weight as something Trump has said and then denied and then said again."
1|Clearly trump won because this shows he has the best temperament
0|Pretty sad if that is considered to be her best debate accomplishment.
1|You really can't get more anti-establishment than a billionaire American businessman.
0|Any bets on how soon we see some tweets from Trump about this?
0|And the nominee should be campaigning and not attacking the the speaker of the house.
1|Obviously when she was Secretary of State she should have been forcing her domestic policy on the United States.
1|I'm sure he'll pivot halfway into his first term
1|"Yeah I'm sure all the people being raped and killed at the time were all ""you know, considering historical context, this is fine""."
1|That's something completely different because homosexuality is a sin!
1|Unlike the democrat or the republican nominees
0|He has said the same thing Pence said
1|Lets not blame the 150,000,000 non-voters, lets blame the 90,000 green voters.
1|For whatever its worth, I don't believe you.
1|You forgot the
1|Of course, it is TRUMP that is the shining beacon of Christian morality.
0|Yup, thought that was pretty standard.
1|I'm pretty sure that doesn't disqualify you if you go to Chicago
1|It's on the internets so it must be.
1|The nomination was rigged.
1|Dear Leader will protect you.
1|Like a true Christian...
1|But hey gotta protest vote amirite?
1|back when america was great
0|You gotta be a banker to know what she's for - her platform isn't real
0|Secretary of ball washings.
0|I'm imagining it was more like he'd insult the theater kids for being pansies, they'd mock him much more creatively, and then he'd just walk away with his fingers in his ears saying he won.
0|"""Doesn't it mean chief?"""
1|In a rare move,  politics bends the truth.
0|I'm not saying they maliciously added votes or suppressed them, but I think it was pretty clear through either the leaked emails from the DNC or just watching the coverage of her and Sanders in the primaries, that the DNC did have a preference, while at the same time loudly proclaiming they were unbiased.
1|I think if every state voted for Clinton, and trump had people on his doorstep chanting **give it up** he still would not admit to losing.. Because we all know how the whole thing is rigged
0|I see HuffPo is up to it's usual ~~quality~~ shill heavy, biased and unsupported journalism once again.
0|Why would donald speak to a super pac?
0|Let this history books show, Obama was the President we wanted, but he is much better than what we deserved.
0|They are moral frauds.
0|lol good point
0|Hillary never separated these groups out, she spoke to them in a way better than Bernie did which is why she won most of the groups you speak of in the primary, I have no doubt Bernie cared about these people, enough of his supporters didn't in the general though as these groups have more at risk under a Trump Presidency, if you feel speaking to these groups to the unique issues that affect them specifically as targeting people at the expense of others, it's possible you didn't care that much about the issues they faced either
0|Waltons back the candidate that will continue the status quo for US multinationals.
0|Like a momo salad?
0|"Obama would have dropped ""stop whining"" in the first 10 minutes of the first debate"
0|He's heard of it, but I doubt he follows foreign politics.
0|No thanks, I prefer sleeping at night
0|2 condescending buzzwords, I wonder if I can guess who you are voting for...
0|"Says the N-word, then ""no offence"" ... What type of mental gymnastics are people like this guy doing?"
1|The dozens of people who look down on me really make me reconsider my vote.
0|I'm convinced that Trump doesn't like AC because his family has a net worth much higher than him.
1|Clearly you just don't get sarcasm.
0|this makes no sense at all.
0|This may be preferable to being coated in US Spam.
0|Your poor colon.
0|All the ones I spoke too were voting because she's a female..
0|You forgot the part about them shooting cops.
1|The party of personal responsibility strikes again.
0|hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
1|"""real men"" make death threats"
0|And in most case appreciate in value.

0|Except that one of the reasons she opposes the final draft of the TPP is that it benefits big pharmacy too much, and not the patients.
0|Don't forget educated women, that's the other third.
0|Well, I mean, the other party came down to Trump vs Cruz, so the Dems win the comparative rationality race by default.
0|If you have studied any previous election, Florida and NC always go back and forth, pretty much hourly.
0|I think you mean: SAD!
0|"By ""overhaul"" they mean ""destroy and replace with a voucher system that will do nothing to control costs or even guarantee they'll cover the cost of care."""
0|Zero chance of something like this getting passed.
0|To be fair, the only reason McMullin is listed is he may actually win Utah.
0|A failed comedy act.
0|It would be like the debate he offered Bernie Sanders.
0|I'm not a Trump supporter.
0|what is the southern strategy for 500 alex
0|That's ok, I am used to it being a fence rider and all.
0|Smug attitudes like this are why Trump won.
0|I think it's more that they said sorry
0|A bump, though... *sniff*
0|We should keep track of how many people ditched Trump only when his comments concerned white women, and not any of the other extremely offensive things he said about other minorities.
0|"Is thees vhat you call ""Pussy Riot""?"
1|But Hillary!
1|Are you trying to tell me that someone who suggested that family members of terrorists are fair game is a sociopath?
0|So its criminal for someone to meet someone who is assosiated with child traficking, then why isnt bill clinton in jail
0|I would love to see long lines of rich white people waiting to vote at the only voting station within a couple of miles on election day having to get emergency court orders to keep the polls open past 8 pm so they can all vote.
1|Yeah because racist idiots are capable of critical thinking
1|Yeah instead let's just have 8 swing states get all the attention and promises!
0|Not in a world where Clinton's supporters insist on having their vote :/
0|I wouldn't even guarantee that *entirely*.
0|IIRC the difference between the two definitions of unemployment haven't changed much in the last decade or two.
0|Politifact: Nah, it's lemon.
0|The Syrian civil war started in 2011.
0|Alright, I mean, I'd really like to try and help you, but you've already made up your mind.
0|Make a point please.
0|Cool so you're not voting for Hillary then?
1|But she took money from Saudi Arabia!
0|And you think Clinton hired protestors after she lost..?
1|I dunno, I typed her symptoms into Web MD and it says she's been dead for ten years.
0|What are hillary's wars, exactly?
0|Grasping at straws, since the electoral math doesn't add up for Trump.
1|I'm sure this will look good in 2020 or 2024.
1|It was a false flag, the poll worker cut her own hand!
0|That really made me laugh.
0|What do you think was inside that van?
0|Ok make sure you screencap this and come back to me when she is lol.
0|And he's the smartest one of the bunch
1|Oh good picking one of two political extremes will surely help to unify us even further
1|Let's elect Hillary because she respects the democratic process so much.
0|Don't you mean hasn't all the swamp been drained from this metaphor?
0|Trump supporters didn't get the memo.
0|Well we'll be stuck with Clinton for at least four years soI hope it's worth it.
0|Yes, providing ALL the people better access to participate and have their voiced heard is SOOOOOOO much more insidious than limiting their ability and silencing them.
0|How is this about american politics?
0|I assume this is an attempt to get close enough for a shanking.
0|Actually...
0|"""If"""
0|Plus unvetted, and, in the case of veritas, selectively edited.
0|All the power is with one party now.
0|Completely disagree with you.
1|History shows that there is nothing dangerous about security forces falling in line behind an authoritarian leader.
0|"""Everybody's doing that"""
0|So how did hillary, master of rigging elections, lose to obama?
1|Because we live in a post-racist society, obviously
0|No matter what the polls say vote.
0|Trump would've actually won by 97% like Ramzan Kadyrov &amp; Kim Jong Un.
1|He can't say the Ave Maria, that sounds like something the Mexicans would say
1|We caught the Boston Bomber guys!
1|Everything was fine for us white people, everyone else should just grin and bear it.
0|Because, as we all know, the Conservatives would have totally sat down with Clinton to talk it out, right?
0|The caskets of the four Americans that died in Benghazi?
0|Sarah Palin is going to be there too!
0|He's been in a safe space his whole entire life.
1|Pfft, diabetic, must be his own fat-ass fault.
1|Except that the reason Trump's tax plans fail is obviously because of dems in congress and Obama's run has fucked things so much even our great god daddy, or whatever those guys call Trump, couldn't save it
0|But but but, nobody respects women more than Donnie!
0|Thats why i voted today (huge line btw)
0|Upvote, because I feel it's true.
0|Yeah I saw that, oh well.
0|"""Ivanka honey, do you need me to wash your back?"""
0|Honest question, do you have dementia?
0|Then why fake purity when you know even the pious are shams?
0|provide evidence of Clinton being involved in corruption please
0|False equivalence.
0|I thought she was the villain?
0|Color me surprised
0|I'm a fan of state law too, and the state laws say the electors must vote the will of the state.
0|Sorry for misunderstanding, but there are a lot of people in this thread who seem to be serious.
0|Scrooge McDucks moneybin?
0|When someone gets raped by a Clinton, the standing policy is to blame the victim and discredit their story.
0|Yes I'm sure Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell will make a stand any day now, likely following in the footsteps of the fearless media.
0|It's just one poll, but she is now pre-comey levels in it which is good
0|Well, it was a *violent comment*
1|To bad the dead don't have higher turnout
1|Because he killed her.
0|Just admit you're wrong.
0|I think you missed his point because you are saying the same thing he is I think
0|so why did my rates go up every year BEFORE the ACA if they weren't being strangled by the big bad government by being forced to cover actually sick people?
0|Why don't you go look it up and report back...
1|What are those?
0|Am I gonna have to put on training wheels for this conversation?
0|If we criminalize being stupid, we are going to have a much less productive country.
1|Like when Ronald Reagan said he liked to grab women's genitals without their consent...
1|Yeah, having a presidential candidate that a large number people don't trust with nukes is clearly inconsequential...
0|For real, I had people messaging me articles on FB about Pence wanting to have electro shock therapy for gays, not only did I find out it wasn't true, he never even supported electro shock therapy.
0|and he just assumed that we peasants dont have access to clear water
0|November 2015 article
0|It's just the tip, don't charge him with rape until he is really in there...
1|Yeah, it's Hillary's fault that Trump supporters lash out violently at anyone who disagrees with political opinion....
0|look, this is apparently a difficult concept for you to grasp, but when I talk about people that I know, the people that you know are actually not who I am talking about at all.
1|Why should he pay if he's dissatisfied with the outcome?
1|I guess I should have added a
0|So the voter score is now Trump 1, Clinton 0 Only about a hundred million more votes to come...
0|'member when Obama was an elitist because of Dijon mustard?
1|No, no, no, Donald is going to make the best deals with gyna and his kids is great with computers so he can be the ambassador to the robots, then he'll end free trade, and allllllllll those manufacturing jobs will come back.
0|That Trump lies constantly.
0|Trump has made clear that anyone who thought he was serious about bringing back coal is a chump.
0|People who only watched Comedy Central knew more about what was going on the world than people who only watched Fox News.
0|These are medical emergencies in which the life of the mother is in the balance.
0|You would think after 8 years of Obama not taking their guns they would figure out the GOP may be misleading them a tad
0|I'm sure Rudy would be happy to move in and help him out.
0|"I think this is supposed to mean ""Be ready for a typhoon of fake news on facebook and twitter"""

0|This man needs some serious help.
1|So burn that mother down
1|We're obviously just so awesome that even if our country is garbage compared to the past, it's still the best in the world
0|"Halfway through, he'll stand up, say ""screw you guys, I'm going home"" and walk off the stage in a huff"
0|Why not both?
0|Maybe he meant the inauguration would be catered by Jimmy John's.
0|Or the shooting in Des Moines.
0|And a scammer.
0|Precisely.
0|or some straight Venezuelan ideas like Trump used like state subsidizing coal mines despite that there isn't even a market.
0|There are going to be some amazing books written about Trump's dumpster fire of a campaign.
0|Yea, all those people who aren't going to Hillary's rallies are going to magically show up and vote for her.
0|No, as someone who's had to live with this assclown for years, this is who he is and has always been.
0|That depends, is it shaped like a brightly-colored burro?
1|he's to busy to listen to the lyrics though
1|Hispanics are getting duped by the dishonest media, but uneducated whites are seeing through the lies.
0|It never happened , trump 2016
0|If i lost an election to Trump, I would never even leave my house again.
0|What currently isn't the case?
0|Because there are number of people to believe it does, or claim it does, and it looks to be the source of economic problems.
0|It is generally true, because most of the people who don't vote are inclined to vote democrat if they did.
0|Every corner, duh.
0|My favorite was that unhinged Newsweek writer Eichenwald writing about secret GOP oppo files on Sanders, the entirety of which was a DNC oppo files including attacking him from the left on the environment

0|We have a cartoon you could show them for how a bill becomes a law.
1|Yeah, she obviously owes the Republican party for all the awesome they have done for her throughout her life as a black woman.
0|Most of the nouns and verbs in the headline should be in scare quotes
0|They were telling her to kill zombie Vince Foster
1|Yeah America is doomed, the spread of tasteless will kill us all
0|Hopefully this serves as a warning to the moderators of the debates to not be complacent.
1|mlk jr died for our racist sins so we are now all absolved and stop complaining
1|Obviously that's obamas fault too!
0|I voted
0|"Trump didn't have to run a campaign, the media ran it for him; all Trump had to do was whistle like a ""German Shepard,"""
0|You're right, I often forget about all the ied's I used to have to dodge on my way to work, not to mention the suicide bomber that was always in front of me at McDonalds.
0|We must replenish our strategic maple syrup supply.
0|Also michigander unfortunately voter turnout is low in detroit apparently
1|What a shock!
0|This was said repeatedly in this sub and downvoted heavily for going against Clinton.
0|The point of me using hyper-conservative to describe Trump's potential SCOTUS nominee is that many of the judges on his list are against gay rights.
0|Even if he didn't, his comments towards POWs are deplorable, so he's still in a good position to tell Donny to go fuck himself.
0|Also, don't pretend like an individual vote alters the outcome of any election.
0|Can you say false equivalence?
0|"The fallacious theories of trump blamed ""the other"" for ""stealing"" the rust belt jobs."
0|Not actual news site
1|Yes because he's just gonna stop being president.

1|You were taking him literally, not seriously.
1|No, we all know that Hillary is a lizard who has no feelings whatsoever.
1|Well, we already know that Hillary murdered four brave patriotic Americans at Benghazi with her own two hands, so what else would be new?
0|If you want diplomacy just watch Justin Trudeau.

0|R'amen!
0|I think the idea is looking towards the future a little damage control by mentioning him would help the divide in the party.
0|I'm no pro-Trump I'm just anti-circle jerk
0|Sick argument bro.
0|Haha you're electing Bank Of America
1|Uh huh, the people who actually qualified and experienced and accomplished enough to have an opinion on the matter worth anything to others all say the opposite to you, but sure, tell us how you see through the conspiracy right through the accomplished scientific world, which definitely wasn't a notion fed to you by big polluters and the cheerleaders of a political side who hate anything 'green' or 'progressive', even when the science aligns with it.
1|Well they *are* the ones who have the guns.
0|Because as a nation we vote for charm, personality and good looks instead of ability?
1|What a bunch of racists.
0|Are you disregarding where he has promised to sign the First Amendment Defence Act and the list of those he'd coaster for Supreme Court justice just all happen to be anti LGBTQ in their stances?
0|That's like comparing a bank robber to a petty thief.

0|What does that mean?
0|Not in this eco chamber...
1|Well, hey, clearly it doesn't matter that several other countries' intelligence agencies have all come to the same conclusion; obviously MI:6 and Mossad are on the DNC dole, right?

0|Whew, it definitely feels good to be a liberal and know we own the media.
0|They are just creating new jobs!
0|Trump is basically the worst, most hated person in the world right now.
0|Explain to me what's wrong with Blodget's methodology without insulting him personally.
0|There seems to be a vast criminal conspiracy within the DNC and Democratic party, which is now being unraveled... piece by rotten piece, by journalists and citizens on both the right and the left.
0|Trump won with less votes than John McCain had against Obama.
1|Just stop with your white-male agenda.
1|This article is full of evidence.
0|Does the kool-aid taste faintly of almonds?
1|Thats makes very little business sense
0|Motherfucker's been dividing by zero and whatnot
1|They point out a lot of Trump's hypocrisy and aren't afraid to admit their bias so obviously it's fake shill news that only tells lies.
0|"It'll be interesting watching them boast about having such large roles in positions of power and also keep up the ludicrous ""White Genocide"" argument"
1|And he promised all true Americans liebensraum....literally giving all of them a living room from the Cindy Crawford collection (ikea is for communists!)
1|But don't call them dumb, it's why trump won
1|Yeah that makes more sense..
0|However i would still heavily support its release and distribution :)
1|Ah so when Hillary loses, maybe voting machines were hacked, but there's no way they were hacked in the primaries
0|Don't worry guys, they're mostly just spam bots.
1|You're right, if it's one thing I heard during this election cycle it's that everyone loved their choices.
0|"What would be the rabid base of the Democratic party is so easily swayed by stupid spin tactics that more often than not they either vote for third-party candidates with no hope of winning, or don't vote at all in ""protest""."
1|I'm sure this billionaire knows exactly how to improve our public schools.
1|I feel America getting greater already, aren't you excited everyone?
1|You weren't THERE, man /those of us who stayed up all night
0|I guess he's preparing for a sneak attack and don't want to give it away by talking.
1|Pence will make better decisions anyway.
1|Yeah, she was probably prepping secret private email servers all over the White House.
1|That's too hard though
0|I shiver when I think of the voting habits of the townies from my hometown.
0|Of course it was a lie, are we supposed to believe Trump was the voice of reason?
0|It's almost like the US is relatively sparsely populated and has lots of farmland, even in blue states!
0|But isn't Trump the one who gets all upset when SNL pokes fun at him?
1|Ah, so THIS will be the thing that stops him.
1|Be patriotic ... consume until it hurts.
0|Why don't we determine the dead, incarcerated, disenfranchised and illegal voters, while we're at it?
1|Nah man, that makes you a dirty commie loving socialist.
0|For someone who's pro LGBT and against racism, Trump sure does appoint a lot of racist people and homophobes.
0|And Bernie supporters apparently.
0|"You're gonna need to go into more detail about what point you talking about ""faithess electors"""
1|Because he's smart.
1|But everything else he's doing is perfectly acceptable.
1|2016 has been a shit year, lets end it with a bang and re-vote
1|Yeah, I for one can't wait for federal contractors to be able to discriminate against gay people again.
0|I mean he loves torture and collateral damage, of course the FoP love him.
1|Yes, let's let these people choose the president for us.
1|Hillary is totally not evil..
0|how are congressman allowed to have legal insider trading?
1|Well as long as God's in charge, no big deal if a few feathers get rustled.
0|It's what happens when people can't get over it, so they try to blame the system that works as intended and act as if the popular vote means anything when they played and campaigned for the EC.
0|They're protected by the Senate, even small population states like Montana get the same representation as California there.
0|I wonder what pew poll found when they asked syrians if they think the punishment for apostasy should be death....
1|Oh yes he has, he said it's beautiful, just beautiful.
0|And someone from Trump's campaign punched an old lady last week.
0|^ clearly has no idea wtf is going on, go back under your rock.
1|Come on, the poor man can't survive on $1 salary!
1|Time to build an American gulag in Alaska.
1|Maybe he wanted to investigate the stories &amp; uncover THE TRUTH.
1|It's not real news unless its biased towards Trump!
0|Wow... that sucks.
0|Repatriation has bipartisan support
1|Impossible, any plan that involves the federal government in anything other than preventing icky sex acts or military spending is illegitimate and can't be a success as a result.
0|Lmfao as if anyone who owns a buissnes doesnt have an accountant?
0|When you get downvoted to the point you can only comment once every ten minutes, that's pretty much censorship.
0|Okay buddy
1|Yeah let California and New York decide every presidency.
1|The Mexican invasion...
1|Too busy talking about what a great man he is, and the many great things he's done.
1|Which part of Trump's plan caused her to change her vote?
1|Good, those people were really suffering under Obama's socialist regime.
0|God, this is the best you've got today?
1|But all he did was play golf
1|Don't drag yoopers into this
1|If he doesn't I'm sure Trump will.
1|O rly?
0|Even aside from that, documentation did come out that even if the primary wasn't formally rigged with vote changing and whatnot, there was a whole lot of malfeasance on the part of the Democratic party that actively undermined people's opinions of the democratic process.
1|It's not racist, white people are just better
1|But those only proved he was smart!
1|That's why we must rid ourselves of the scourge of Obamacare.
0|"""And that's a fact."""
1|Well some jobs are better than keeping no jobs, right?
0|He must have seen how effective it was watching an internet troll win the US presidency.
0|They've also made them for other people, Bin Laden, Trayvon Martin, etc.
1|Trump backing out on his promises to help the working class and instead helping his billionaire buddies, why I would never... If only someone had warned us that he would do this....
1|But it's worse for them in Saudi Arabia!
0|Enjoy the impeachment, Cledus.
0|If he acts as a proponent of legal marijuana will you change your opinion about him or Republicans?
0|No, we actually have a ridiculously powerful military.
0|a third of pro-drumpf tweets are from bots.
1|Sessions wasn't first lady or secretary of state, so he had nowhere near as much control over laws and policy as HRC!
1|His salary went up because he worked hard and earned it, his medicare increase went up because moochers and freeloaders are voting in democrats to ruin the country.
0|That's what some are saying.
0|But did you know that San Francisco is closer to Hawaii than Los Angeles?
0|"I would say ""semantically true"" accounts for context."
1|Because e-mails and BENGHAZI.
0|Someone didn't even bother to read the article.
1|Yea putting your countries interests first is horrible
1|We really forced their hand by nominating a woman...
0|But if you take non-politicians and start having them create and implement policy in redistricting, don't they become you know, politicians?
1|Trump says wages in the US are too high, perfect place to start.
1|Whew, that was clever!
1|Yes, these are the only 2 options in this situation
0|fake news /reported
1|Because they sure did well by cozying up to the Republicans.
0|Yeah, his name was James Comey.
1|It's been 2 years now, get over it!
0|If you posted a source for your claim that Obama didn't create any jobs I would click it.
1|What a shill thing to say.
1|Oh that would be just horrible!
1|Clean burning oil and coal
1|Oh god i hope you forgot the
1|but apple stuff just worksTM!
0|*Miss Teen USA
1|So noble, so brave.....
0|Are you asking about why I think his economic policies are better or why I think America is a great place to be?
1|I trust Paul Ryan.
1|Build the swamp!
1|My bad should have added.....
0|Man look at all these principled conservatives.
1|Mmmkay, way to once again say things that are relevant to the conversation
0|Seriously who cares what overpriced shit she wears.
0|"All jobs that are threatened like this will only be ""Saved"" until the next quarter."
1|This isn't the place for sane compromise!
0|Yeah, I would like nothing more than these recounts to show that Donald actually lost, but this was always the most likely outcome.
1|Yeah but when you take away all the illegal votes Donnie won the popular vote in a landslide!
1|Hope she wins the election!
1|Then you'll be thrilled to look into the Trump budget and see the fiscal conservatism he espouses
1|"Nah nah correlation is not causation those states just have more ""urban thugs"""
0|Especially in Calfornia, but we know that won't happen, the blood sucking leech Democrat government here loves that illegal finger pushing on the scale.
0|Hypocrite.
1|Plus, there will be far fewer people to argue with after the sick ones die!
0|Cool ~~Ivan~~ John, maybe one day we meet up to watch the ~~FC Spartak~~ Jets game and have ~~borscht~~ burgers and ~~vodka~~ beer.
1|even so, everything is the republican party's fault, HuffPo Says so!
1|But....Hillary was the corporate shill
1|*person with opposing viewpoint must be getting paid* Flawless logic
0|There absolutely has been.
1|It's called 'High Energy' duh.
1|C'mon, she's maybe a Trump 6, and we all know Trump would NEVER grope below a Trump 8!
1|Yes, because you're going to make up a 4 million vote lead in California and a 1.7 million vote lead in NYC........ Oh, I forgot this...
1|Of course they are, Russians are now our comrades!
0|Did this poll come from the same people who said hillary would win for sure?
1|The MSM has always been against Trump, which is why its great to have such wonderful resources as Breitbart.
0|If PKD was alive, he'd be 89 now.
1|"""Make America even greater!"""
0|I think we all know he would grab the woman, and where he would grab her.
1|ya, lets listen to what trump fans say, cause they're SO smart
1|Lazy bums!
0|Nothing you said, but Trump is just using it as his own personal charity/ slush fund.
1|Your doing such a great job
0|He could also order the US military to delete the Russian military, and cause them to go bankrupt as they attempt to rebuild it.
1|FAKE NEWS
0|I bet it's a cheap knock off
1|But we are the good guys!
0|Get reported
0|Jesus I hope that stupid fucking subreddit gets banned
0|A Kasich Sanders administration would be fantastic.
0|To the Republicans who impeached him have never had affairs, been married only once, and stayed vaginal virgins it was immoral.
1|Stop being sexist!
1|I for one am excited for our new Comrade in Cheif.
1|But Russians are white and like us... Saudis are brown and scary!
1|TIL that smart people sell steaks through RadioShack.
0|They sort of recognize how he conned other people but the last thing they will admit is that he conned them.
0|So what do you think of Echo Fox?
0|Remember how Obama spends an hour each day going over the paper copies of the reports and Trump doesn't?
1|Well, if the election is always going to go the way the Chicago machine wants it to, why bother?
1|No you wake up Reddit, Republicans don't give a damn what y'all think or say or fight for...
1|Smart people don't do press conferences.
1|Such good governing!
0|Cant wait for the coming season of VEEP.
0|He is actually predictable
0|Oh jesus christ Bill, what are you doing?
1|Well, they are just theories you know.
1|Science is when a lot of people believe something, right?
1|how about Bill Murray
0|No, like Hillary Clinton
0|I wish I could upvote you more.
1|But these are the same people who told us Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
1|I see SO much tolerance for people of different ideas and opinions from progressives here.
1|Yeah seriously, they're all in on the conspiracy!
0|Deport him.
1|I suppose it's better for the minority to elect a demagogue than the majority.
1|So I guess the Donald only won by 200,000 votes if you don't count the illegal immigrants voting in California.
0|Unsurprisingly, they have not been listening.
1|No, he's just telling it like it is!
1|Putting all that Democratic money donated to the NCGOP to good use I see.
0|"Yeah... I'd like to see whatever ""mathematics"" they did for this statistical analysis."
0|It's another case of misleading headline
0|And you know this would have three times as many upvotes if Hillary had done the same.
1|Yeah, but the 'all caps' later on was pretty persuasive.
1|Well, if this doesn't convince people that she had a hand in the Kennedy assassination, then nothing will.
1|It's ok, I'm sure he'll pay taxes on the earnings.
0|An ongoing interest in this, even while President-Elect does start to look like a conflict of interest to me, but for the sake of argument, I won't disagree - my point was more that the headline was misleading.
1|Oooohhhh, Scott Baeo... Swoon...
0|Triggered.
0|Not Melania.
0|Jesus, these Democrats are desperate not to look in the mirror.
1|"Because she looks like a linebacker and she's a ""race baiter"" or some shit"
1|"""because it's hard"""
1|No it came entirely from New York City, god at least get the narrative right, fellow centipede!
0|Based on how closely they follow the laws in the Quran obviously
1|They didn't like him because he was a Democrat, not because he was mixed race
1|I clearly should have added a
0|Or people can just stop being assholes and stop voting A and B and choose C. Voting A or B has gotten us to where we are today.
1|clever, you must be in the smart half of the population
0|He can't protect him from himself.. we need to perpetually anger him and hope he goes on non-stop twitter tirade eventually leading to a coke-induced heart attack.
1|Listen to this commie with his crazy ideas!
0|You also probably pay taxes, the rules that apply to the rest of us don't apply to Trump.
0|Show me evidence to the contrary of the article.
1|I am sure that will solve all his issues.
0|I had to zoom in way too far to see that 's'
0|I think Reagan would pissed about us selling Russia 20 percent of our uranium.
1|The second amendment still means the same as it did back then so it's all good.
1|Finally, I can get back to discriminating against the LGBTQ people, with Obama gone it didn't make sense being a racist anymore.
1|But he would have campaigned differently if you deduct the millions of illegal votes!
1|Yeah, this just shows that Trump is telling it like it is and doesn't care about any of that PC bullshit.
1|We removed the town of Sandy Hook, these actors can go somewhere else
1|Thank you for addressing my argument, and thank you for actually having an argument.
1|Worked out in Kansas.
1|Don't you know, it's all the (((Globalists))) fault.
1|I'm sure that will keep an open dialogue and convince your family members to side with your worldview.
0|I'd be more than happy to find out there was a government conspiracy to ~~assassinate~~ oust this clown.
0|He still won.
1|But, her emails!
1|But people had to vote for Trump, because Hillary was too hawkish.
0|I'm saying that it's highly likely that legislation will be repealed by the Trump administration.
0|Love me some Rawls
0|So you're saying Bernie was the daughter sacrifice that sickened so many, and didn't gain anything worthwhile.
1|But that was true so it can't be classified as defamation.
0|Haha, no problem, I appreciate the reply.
1|But there's no difference between Hillary and Trump, so it's OK.
0|I just moved from there a week ago and now this happens?
1|When they go low we go lower
0|I say we hang them... Grab your pitchforks ---E ---E ---E ---E---E ---E---E ---E---E ---E---E ---E
1|As an uneducated white man from Texas who has never traveled outside the neighborhood, I have a very keen understanding on foreign issues.
1|You're right, because everyone else has the right to self-determination except for the Jews.
1|Yeah, I'll take the word of dcman here on this one.
1|This whole thread was making a mockery of ignorant Trump supporters, I didn't think I needed to add an
1|"""You just trust us, the government to tell you what is truth and what is not"""
1|So...the same as the major news/political subreddits?
1|Yes, the benevolent insurance companies will lower rates because they hate making money.
1|You dropped this:
1|Take that America!
0|Implying it had a beginning
1|Nah, Russia completely undermined the faith of our election, which is why despite the fact the election margin was razor thin, clearly had such an impact, it has NOTHING to do with Hilary's arrogance and self coronation!
1|Said mean things.
0|care to elaborate?
0|I couldn't tell you why racism and sexism exist, but I can tell you that a fuck ton of people voted for a man whose primary campaign point was racism.
1|Yeah, we never hear about Muslims doing bad things!
1|"But...but...they have the cool ""Make Mexico Great Again Also"" hats."
0|OP's user name definitely does not check out.
1|Next up Arizona!
1|Instead of electing politicians who serve wealthy donors, we should just put one of those wealthy donors as the president; cut out the middle man!
0|Glad they're checking the important facts.
0|This isn't family fude, I don't care.
1|Good one.
0|"Could that possibly be because ""racist"" and ""sexist"" have progressively lost all meaning beyond being a buzzword applied to people you disagree with?"
1|Yeah, They should teach communism in school.
0|Oh no, are you going to tattle on me to the mods?
0|How many rubles was that?
1|Yeah the media is so hard on Clinton.
1|You heard it here first folks, all Bernie supporters are lazy and just want free stuff!
1|The only teacher they need is Trump
1|No, the gubment isn't allowed to do anything good
0|Or when video surfaces of you and your butt-buddy Billy Bush sounding like a couple of certified bonehead jerks
0|I'll show you some nice some furniture
0|How is he doing now?
1|Yeah, Trump is *so* svelte and fit.
0|If you don't think Trump's business practices have hurt the average American, you haven't been reading enough.
1|Got it, voting Trump now.
1|Sure because trump was chosen by the elites to rule us all
0|Please clap.
0|So the average Friday for him?
1|Well she did call for the special elite forces protecting the ambassador to stand down when the terrorists were pointing their AK-47s at him.
1|You mean to tell me you never seen those necromancer pollsters going to cemeteries and raising the dead, asking them who they will be voting for in November?
1|Consider this race over I guess, those huge crowds obviously mean Trump will take all 50 states.
1|Why can't we just nuke them?
1|This is why Colorado has become a burning hellscape of violence.....
1|Sure thing buddy
1|Yep obviously they just went missing and she had no idea
1|Stop being so PC.
1|oh yeah i agree, every president must go through a vigorous exam testing their knowledge of every single bomb and weapon the military uses.
1|I welcome the day where we stop thinking critically about the content contained inside of articles to determine the legitimacy of the arguments being forwarded.
0|Julian Assange will remain alive until Vladimir Putin decides he is no longer useful.
0|Well, it's usual that in such controversial matters people just take one side and stick with it, thinking about the true complexity of this kind of problems isn't easy.
1|They're not people with opinions, they're bigots!
1|A wall, duh
1|common sense is no fun, party pooper...
1|'pneumonia' sure, that's what it is.
1|Only rational way to think when you don't have people agreeing with you.
1|I knew this would Happen!
1|When you use sarcasm on the internet it's polite to include a sarcasm tag like
1|It was just allergies on friday.
1|I know, right, and it's not like those shareholders get taxed at a lower rate than those people working their lives away.
0|I'm at the point where I don't know what to believe about anything in this election.
0|That's what happens with ailing dictators.
1|So eloquent and convincing.
1|What massacre and what shootings?
0|So... what the actual fuck is Clinton trying to achieve with this?
0|lol OK have fun on  conspiracy
0|I don't think she's *fluent* in five...just has a passing knowledge of five because she comes from Europe.
1|Something just sounds wrong with that logic,
1|you may get your wish!
0|I think you mean $200 thousand.
1|They're under audit, that's why.
0|I'd rather it be a self driven rent-a-pod I don't own that comes and goes as I please.
1|Yeah FDR was a punk bitch too!
1|See no problem.
0|And forest fires.
1|No no no, that cannot *possibly* be the reason

0|Jesus is too liberal for them
0|Is Pence tied to any companies that would profit greatly from destruction and warfare?
1|Both parties are exactly the same!
0|Nor does it revolve around religion, which is what Pence thinks.
1|Because birth certificates were not a thing when he was born.
0|If you purchase from a terrible donut shop
0|True, t_d is already going to be *pissed* when they find out a Fox exec is trying to undo all their hard work!
0|Having been employed at Chuckie's for nearly a year, yes alcohol is still served and the mouse being in charge scares me more than trump
1|Yes, the lifelong New York liberal is going all in to ban abortion.
1|"Yeah, that was totally her response ""whenever"" Bernie made a point"
1|Nah, more likely the entire world is brainwashed and conspiring against us
1|Because when I think of Hillary, I think of ethics.
1|Stop your identity politics they only tear us apart!
1|well god's not going to breed his own army of followers!
1|Didn't he copy her on the whole birther thing?
1|But she's not cuddly and I don't feel like she'd be fun to have a beer with so I'm going to vote third party and help elect the fascist.
0|Let me see if I can remember which of the two candidates was encouraging their supporters to beat people up... hrm...
0|What do you recommend they do instead?
0|What specific sources related to this?
1|"Maybe they all make ""furtive gestures"""
1|A black man is president.
1|If Obama hadn't divided the country so much, there wouldn't have been a vacuum created for the likes of Trump to rise.
0|To take care of those pesky Ukrainians
1|Yeah clearly her voting history shows that.
1|But no racism happened before Obama!
1|Let's not jump to conclusions until all the online polls are factored in!
0|I saw on twitter that HRC used the Clinton Foundation to buy a 6 foot tall painting of herself.
1|They're the media, shut up an listen.
0|Peter Thiel isn't being considered by Trump anyway (not on his short list, and no credible sources to say he's being considered), this article is junk, only upvoted because it bashes Trump.
0|Well yea, but this... unfortunately, is all we got
1|But he said believe me!
1|"Also ""hey, buying investments at the bottoms of a market collapse is good business"" wow, what a revelation"
0|oops, thanks
1|It's very unfair, how she seems to know all this stuff he doesn't.
1|Yes, it's a damn shame she's been able to avoid investigations up until this point.
0|Actually it kind of makes me wonder if her being sick was some sort of an act to take our attention away from legitimate issues.
1|Yes, because those insurance companies are sure to absorb that loss of money and not pass it on to their policyholders.
0|So you're saying everyone should set up a fake charity to funnel tax free money through in order to dodge the IRS?
1|Yeah I mean we're the ones that fought for slavery, then segregation, and then turned water hoses on civil rights protesters.
1|Did it teach the two party system a lesson?
1|That's called business
0|I'm sure this guy has a huge social circle with reposting 4chan memes and joking about death threats.
1|But but Clinton email tech guy pleaded 5th, why aren't we talking about that?
0|Also whose husband used to serve in political office
1|Kenyan* family
1|Really glad he's shifting the conversation back to policy and substance
1|God forbid our troops get the equipment and medical help they deserve!
1|"And yet he is ""successful"" and has 10 billion."
1|Since they were illegally obtained, that means those documents aren't true.
0|It's the anti abortion but pro death penalty part i can never get over.
1|I think he's just trying to outdo Hillary's bad weekend.
0|Just key pieces of the leadership that favour looking effective over actually sparing a life based on evidence... I guess you could call their supporters the lazy evil?
1|Sleep in it...with our taxes as nice warm covers.
0|But, perhaps, a win in Florida
0|But Hillary is ok.
1|Hey now, he also gets there in the UPI tracking poll!
1|They've made up so much shit about Obama that at least one must be true.
1|$hills confirmed!
0|wish somebody had the balls to say this about religion.
1|Mocking the disabled then mocking the sick and elderly, how presidential of him
0|Those guys are bottom of the barrel when it comes to reddit as a whole.
0|They may be neocons, but they're not insane...Trump's awfulness has brought people together to achieve a common goal: do not let Trump in the White House.
1|Can we *unskew* these polls?
1|Yeah well, your probably a white male, so your example is invalid anyway.
0|She answered this during the debates.
0|As I remarked, it's far from self evident that that criterion should ultimately matter.
1|Because it humanized and made a young black boy more important to the country when he should have just been another murdered black.
1|Man, it really seemed like they were going Trump Train.
1|Hillary did such a bang up job of uniting the Democrats in the primary, that this should be obvious.
1|I know I go to shady russian youtube stations for all of my breaking political news needs
0|You don't need to be rich to be a baboon who uses the N-bomb.
1|He just wants to return to the good old days where a wife has a mandate to sexually serve her husband.
1|But crooked hillary is a liar, we have to get behind Trump
0|that's cute, did you come up with that one all by yourself?
0|So you're saying that it's possible that Pence already dropped out months ago?
1|"Yeah but the alternative is a ""blue collar billionaire"" soooo he's obviously more in touch with the middle class, ya know cuz he's ""blue collar"""
1|She personally killed thousands of Americans in Benghazi, duh.
1|alphamales don't sexually assault women who were clearly asking for it by being around them.
1|Oh so Glenn Beck's opinion is suddenly valid among liberal circles?
1|Huh, didn't realize Hawaii had a muslim problem.
1|you misspelled LIEbral.
1|Real?
1|But.. But... But.. He's got the gay!
1|Yeah, but they say the N word in rap songs, so what?
1|But I thought she lacked stamina!
1|But... but... he just *knows* that Clinton is guilty.
0|The inability to take criticism is a large part of being a poor leader.
0|Trump: the elections rigged...I think Trump: Obama's a secret socialist, Muslim...I think Trump: Ted Cruz's father killed JFK...I think
1|He's sorry though guys.
1|Yes, it's actually shorter than the purported birth certificate hoax that installed Barack Obama as a foreign-born president; that one took 55 years to execute.
0|Wise of them to be afraid of that.
0|What odds did you get out of curiosity?
1|Guess we need to ban women from voting to unrig the election.
1|The man hired them to win the election, if they did a bad job of it, then yeah, of course they aren't getting paid.
0|It absolutely does, it was just one of those moments where I was puzzled by the context because I had never heard it in that context.
1|Well, that should help his poll numbers.
1|47% of his tax cuts will go to the top 1%, he's fighting for people just like meeee!
1|"Well yeah, he killed a ""terra-ist"""
0|...seconded.
1|If only cameras were still around to record things people said and did... That would be marvelous.
0|Obama showing the boner to reporters on the plain.
1|U MEAN START A SLUSH FUND

1|She might have sneezed earlier today, clearly it's pneumonia.
1|but but but obama is black so hes race baitinggggg
1|Yeah, this guy sounds totally credible
1|Oooh, the SCANDAL!
1|GET THIS TO THE TOP BOYS
0|Better safe than sorry, you still did the smart choice with what info you had my man.
0|Well since the right wants to keep gitmo open, maybe we should be putting these domestic terrorists there and interrogate them.. I am sure they would love that since we need to have a strong position on terrorists.. Right....?
1|Because it's only men voting for Trump.
1|But at least they're not Muslim!
1|Clearly a cuck who is paid by the global conspiracy...
1|Don't forget the horrifying leftist media.
0|Why not the two what?
1|This isn't his skin being thin this is him showing he has power!
1|Nah - here comes wacky conspiracy theories where a given email WAS A SECRET CODED MESSAGE FOR THE ILLUMINATI
1|Great ground game
1|Hillary BAD!
0|True true... but then again you have to remember we were profiteering hard from WWII and was the king of the economy at the time.
0|Did you see the first one, released yesterday?
1|Yeah, but there's no way that could happen, right?
1|Yeah how dare we not want a rapist president!
1|Cant vote out a war hero.
0|Nah, he'll tight his cool.
1|Oops I forgot the
0|In my experience, the ones who shout and scream are always wimps when the chips are down.
1|yes, once this non-tax paying billionaire with corporate interests comes into office.
1|Biased world wide *liberal* media
0|Okay, so Trump IS warm blooded.
1|Well, it is a rigged election...
1|Add another to the body count
0|What about a Taco that craps ice-cream?
0|Is that because you since he is making fun of you?
1|We should ban alcohol then too.
1|Lies made up by Satan, obviously!
1|I'm sure they're all inspired by Trump's positive message for women.
1|Yeah, providing more HIV/AIDS medication to people who need it and can't afford it sure would be awful
1|Good thing all us plebs aren't smart enough to catch on to this unfathomably subtle strategy
1|Yes, that's a very objective description of what is going on.
1|Maybe he should build an open blog and let anyone contribute whatever they want, why check to make sure its authentic
0|Yeah but duck duck also returns half shit results so, the answer is 'most people' are still using google.
1|Clearly he's the best person to take on limiting free speech because he has so much experience abusing it... I'm pretty sure it's the same idea with those tax loopholes.
1|well NYT is unbiased
1|But both parties are the same
1|He could have had her if he really wanted her.
1|BOMBSHELL, the night before her Birthday, WHO DOES THAT?
1|Not sure if
1|And lying about it
1|Practicing for real life huh?
1|A vote for no one is a vote for Trump!
1|great, he'd hand it off to Pence, that'd make everything better.
1|I pay 6 dollars per day in illinois great thing the government built me roads
0|"What do you mean ""you people""?"
1|Seems legit.
1|Oh but they just talked about golf and grandkids
1|Well I won't argue with a clairvoyant then.
0|The Whigs
0|I view this less as a tactic to drop Trump's support and more of an effort to protect support for Clinton by reminding probable Clinton voters how compromised Trump is.
0|That is ridiculous
0|Well... the more I learn, the worse the whole thing looks.
0|Hahaha
0|Because the employer gets offended very easily.
0|"Who is this mysterious ""Hillary Clinton"" and why have we never heard anything about her?"
0|I'd really like someone to call the GOP out on the bullshit that isn't a comedian by trade.
0|mmm loving the salt
0|House of cards IRL
0|check how old the account of the poster is lol.
0|Yes because southerners love having sex with their daughters.
0|right...
0|Progressively getting sick of this shit bitch.
0|I'm guessing he will make the announcement late Friday with the rest of the Friday night news dump.
0|Fortunately the adults who vote for Hillary don't get their news from the Internet.
0|"You realize he says ""extremist Islamists"" all the time right?"
0|This is the idiot who keeps a Confederate flag on his office desk where he works as an elected representative of a state that fought for the Union and had the highest per-capita casualties in the Civil War.
0|I think, no matter who wins this Presidential election, they won't last 4 years.
1|Because of all the things we know about Hillary, it's that she's an idiot
1|I think you forgot the
0|To the Trump supporters here, it is.
0|Well, there's always next week.
0|Just look up Donald Trump twitter, you'll find it.
0|The puppy would obviously be a Hillary plant
0|Bernie had the same foreign policy as her...
0|America can't afford to lose their only vassal state in the region.
0|I talked to Tom; he doesn't care anymore.
0|I really wish they would start cutting people's mics
0|Last month hillary made me feel like i was a test group for her ads for being here lol
0|Woosh.
0|Same here
0|He does, yes.
0|Does it say Daily Caller anywhere in the article?
0|Yeah they're just a side-effects of rhetoric
0|Sorry, it's this or a meteor apparently.
0|How about Tea Party groups prove they aren't tax cheats?
0|Because they don't actually have anything and just want attention implying they have something and that they might release it someday, if they feel like it, maybe.
0|"Right because in reddit, the burden is not to provide ample evidence, it's to post some speculation and say ""hey I stand by this until you prove it ISNT true"""
0|Kudos to you on that :) personally I find a glass of cold beer or a smooth vape as a great way to end a long day or week.
0|well yeah ... anywhere near the border and at every airport we give up our fourth amendment rights for security theater.
0|Some of us have a whole brain.
0|*Clinton is itching for a convention fight: If platform flashpoints aren't resolved, the former secretary of state says she'll take her battle to the floor of the Democratic convention*....imagine if this was headline if bernie won the primary and clinton refused to endorse him until he moved his policies to the center....
0|Yeah, she was clearly getting under his skin last night with the TrumpU and flip flopping bits.
0|This is pretty fucked up
0|Maybe not so soon but it could happen in the next 2-5 years.
0|Well America does it all the time.
0|He's a fat guy?
1|Comey better watch out for gym equipment.
0|This title has nothing to do with the article.
0|Yet, give them time to think on Trump appointing the next 2 to 3 SCOTUS judges.
0|It's almost like people never change!
0|This was basically the only semi-legitimate criticism he's been making of her, and now he's just as guilty of it as her.
1|I didn't realize the economy was collapsing like it did in 2008
0|Lol- good luck with that...
0|The fact that this was done by a religious psychotic who identified as part of a group that has launched international terrorist attacks against the United States *does* make it more horrible.
0|So is everyone going to chill tf out after the convention then?
0|He is a real fan of kicking the ovalball into the metal thing
0|And when they can't get the Sacramento River they decide they can just build a pipeline from the Columbia.
1|At this point, what difference does it make?
0|No he did a ton of this to himself.
0|You're choosing to ignore one poll because it doesn't support your view, the methodologies are the same.
0|Can you tell me just how far my point is flying over your head?
0|Your anecdotal evidence is resoundingly contradicted by the poll data.
0|You could help.
0|Practicing ye olde short game!
0|I mean he wants to fuck his own daughter...
0|And none of them won nomination.
0|"""moooooooooom they said a bad thing about me make them be in a time out!"""
0|Don't forget Obama!
1|And we all know what's best for corporations is best for America!
0|"""Sometimes stereotypes are factual."""
0|And the Russians.
1|recognizing that racism exists is the real racism
1|Oh yeah that League of Nations thing was a totally nationalistic enterprise
0|You mean Hillary right?
1|That's great, what's his tax policy?
0|I didn't think of it, but the analogy to the church is apt.
0|I guess Vox is calling for Hillary 's campaign team to call off the Nixonian dirty tricks they are running against Bernie Sanders and Bernie Sanders supporters.
0|You are going to have to find another target, I am gone, bye.
0|And if it was Russia sending nukes?
0|Tell me then in your infinite wisdom, what in the past 8 years has been so terrible to define our country as dying?
0|If only he was an entrepreneur.
0|Even with that outlier, she usually has had a 2-3 point lead in Florida.
0|deep.
0|What is funny is that according to Bernie's FEC filings, his campaign actually did accept money from foreign sources.
1|Because there are too many kids smoking weed
0|Mens rea
0|"They ""fundraise"" for Democratic candidates, but keep the funds."
1|Clearly lying to try and cover her ass makes her a sociopath...
0|Agreed, that comment wasn't for jetshockeyfan, it was for the rest of you.
0|What's it like having no clue about the real world?
0|Well I didn't hear her say that, but I've heard people doing analysis of the issue for months pointing out that the violations of secure information were from the people who sent the email -- which is why charges were considered extremely unlikely.
0|ITT: absolutely no counterargument
0|is that what I said?
0|Where's you grenade launcher attachment to your full auto rifle?
1|He doesn't use Canadian toilets...he doesn't want the foreigners to think he gives a shit.
1|It touches my heart to learn how deeply concerned The American Conservative is with the well being of the Left.
0|then you are as foolish as Juan, No way HRC wins TX, ever
0|I can't stop laughing.
0|if that were true one of them would win.
0|I think the original poster was looking forward to when people can call up self-driving ubers to go around town instead of having to maintain their own cars.
1|Watch it Walker, you keep saying nice things about Hillary and you won't get that sweet VP some people think you should get.
0|The voters denied him this chance.
1|yeah and Clinton can TOTALLY be trusted with classified info
0|IIRC The Benghazi investigation is where they noticed she was using a non standard email address.
0|I think simple math should be able to answer that question for you.
0|I've noticed it a lot in governmental institutions.
0|She's the only true weasel left in the race.
0|Bless your heart.
0|Yup
0|He didn't endorse trump though.
0|You know how a person in despair will repeat a prayer to help them from losing it?
0|I will pray to Jesus for the answer and let you know.
1|Yes...let's tread down that incredibly popular path.
0|Oh thank goodness, for a second I'd actually believed that she had successfully defended a rapist she'd known to be guilty.
0|dam those terrorists
0|Luckily the California economy is not based on manufacturing
1|But if we shoot more of the other side we'll eventually win this fight!
1|Yea, and after 9/11 less Muslims died b/c they sure showed us that they are not to be trifled with!
0|"""I'll pass the joint when the rest of you do the same!"""
0|"And then they cry ""propaganda machine"" when we go off to RT and other less reputable sources in order to find more reputable reporting."
1|"Do you not see the ""Clinton"" in the title?"
0|That ought to get applause from his slimy base.
0|It matters to me
0|She believes in alternative medicine too, what a joke.
0|"""Black lives matter"" chants."
0|What I said was that Netanyahu's approach toward Palestinians does not reflect that of the Israeli people.
0|Aside from lip service the environment is not high on Hillary's concerns either.
0|The Dallas PD are not the good guys.
0|That's not much of a rebuttal.
0|Nobody has been here for hundreds of years.
1|Calling people with whom you disagree autistic is a highly persuasive rhetorical technique.
1|Yup, that's what we all think
1|FREE LONG ISLAND
0|Christians mad that Obama is going to veto a bill because it doesn't fund PP in an attempt to make themselves seem like the good guys.
1|Foreign parties couldn't access it, the secret service guarded it the entire time!
0|Pretty sure that was sarcasm
0|I actually threw up a little bit...
0|I'll keep that in mind should the Democrats rig the primary in the future.
1|When Hillary tries to take a liberal position, then she's clearly lying
1|I though Hillary's poll numbers never go up
1|But Trump is on the left of Clinton
1|Yeah what would we do without the ability of people who compromise national security through gross negligence to evade any consequences for their actions.
1|But then the poor and jobless will be eligible for welfare, problem solved!
0|You very clearly did not see or read the full speech.
0|OH, my bad I read that very incorrectly!
0|"I literally start the day by googling ""hillary fbi"" and something new always pops up, lol"
1|Will it be Bernie?
1|Amish conspiracy
0|So her saying she was going to stay in the race in '08 because Obama might get assassinated is what?
0|Yes, the only thing that can overturn an amendment is another amendment.
1|What, nooooo
0|What term?
0|You mean hacked by *North Korea* or *Russia*?
0|Nobody expects your vote, pick whomever you want.
1|gotta ban that health hazard porn though
0|That rat bastard!
0|Its unethical when people donate money and can buy influence.
1|"Mike Pence took a brave stand against the establishment PC police who run the big bad ""cigarettes cause cancer"" fear campaign."
0|Or Scott fucking Baio.
0|Wipe it with a (C)loth?
0|The same way we did before the IRS existed.
1|you forgot your

0|Is it backwards day again already?
0|How fucked up has nation become when blowing someone up with a bomb is 'unremarkable.'
0|That was my first reaction too.
0|Even that though... You'd think with all those resources that someone would be there to co-ordinate to sure Navy SEALS have the weapons they need lol.
0|If not standing in the way of progressive legislation is considered progressive then the bar has been moved to a new low.
0|Don't worry, there's won't be any more after tonight
1|"Yeah, aside from his campaign finance fraud, denial of climate change, religious and racial bigotry, a VP who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade and signed ""religious liberty"" legislation that legalized discrimination against LGBT, etc., Trump's great"
0|but a handful of them were victims of Bill's sexual exploits, and Hillary was the one to slander and destroy them when they came forward!

0|Sean Hannity sure loves Trump.
0|Ah, okay, I misunderstood your intent.
0|Bernie by 10
0|He also has a sarcastic visit scheduled to Washington.
0|He was born in Canada, his dad is Cuban.
1|Italy is just the Mexico of Europe!
1|Right... President Camacho is who we need.
0|you act like facts matter in this election race
1|This place has no democrat bias at all
1|Yea, I saw Trump's genocide speech, heavy stuff
1|But it's our fault!
1|Yes, it's unheard of that the Trump campaign could simply fuck up or steal stuff.
0|Book tour ova
1|Racism is okay against white people because reasons.
0|At least I got him to delete his edit.
0|Fine then, because we get our values from traditional European cultures which looked down upon any nudity.
0|I garun fucking tee you that the same will be true for the DNC
0|I'm ok with that
0|"""think Trump is a liar"" Trump being a liar is a proven fact!"
1|Trump forgot his
0|And its a shit one.
1|Doesn't matter, got coverage.
1|They can eat the tank, right?
1|Maybe Trump can sue Poland!
1|The Secret Service is a bunch of Liberals!
1|Well, she's in charge of everything, so she could have stopped it!
1|Nah, this is just 18D Monopoly from Donald, everyone is just too dumb to see hes playing Putin
0|Shhh you're breaking the circle jerk in action.
1|"Everyone knows the real racists are not the racists, but the people who think that telling the racist ""truth"" is racist."
0|Trump isn't attacking the military industrial complex, he's not pledging to cut back US spending on defense, it's the opposite - he's threatening nations that aren't spending as much on their defense.
0|Not really since the people making the decisions in Brussels are unelected.
0|Then he gets his head cut off and his family is eliminated while the few that are alive go into exile.
0|A very, very small finger (and hand).
0|Guilty feet have got no rhythm?
0|Hopefully they stay away from the gym
0|She was the first clue to something being wrong at the DNC.
1|no fear mongering here... just some honest, unbiased journalism
0|He's been exposed, anyone with half a brain knew that he would bow to HRC when the time came... The DNC let him loose to play a bit with the children, but it's back to business now...
0|I think he means the primary, which is true.
0|Um, it's civil.
0|So was Obama, Bernie, and like every other Democrat.
0|He'd put them on BLAST.
1|The NFL obviously wouldn't have paid shills.
0|Fairly certain that the larger problem is his spewing of hate, and not that he isn't bought by donors.
0|Like with a cloth or something?
0|Do they though?
0|I'm sure he is, Trump identifies as an Orange American.
1|And here I thought the country was getting less sexist.
0|Smart woman.

0|"**The word ""Epic""** *~1700 - 2016* RIP"

1|She was secretary of state, so that means she's smart.
1|Obama and Clinton did 9/11
0|She got paid model pricing for her amazing loo...... couldn't even finish that one :/
0|She entirely hit him on the Castro not being such a bad guy thing just before the Florida primary in a debate.
1|You mean feels aren't good enough?
1|So the DNC shouldn't be neutral until the convention, or even until the votes are officially cast?
0|Tbf, the dem convention wasn't exactly smooth either
1|...and we wonder why she hasn't held a press conference since 2015.
1|Because everyone who supports Sanders obviously will never vote Clinton
1|Sexist much
0|There is a lot of money in hating weed.
0|Sarcasm game on point.
1|As an Australian - I for one welcome our new Trump overlords
0|"""Baby, trump be SO SCARY, that we gotta just look the other way while our savior rigs DAT PRIMARY"" NOPE"

1|Meanwhile, there is nothing delusional about HRC supporters.
1|He really turned around Newark
1|Best way to cause unity if you ask me
0|Ha, some of us are actually pretty disappointed ex-Bernie supporters, fret not.
0|Maybe they should stop trying to be a special snowflake and register for a fucking party.
0|If you have so little faith in the American system of checks and balances, why are you throwing in with someone who just rigged an election?
0|We probably are with Clinton too, but her package is wrapped in prettier paper.
1|You Bernie Bros need to just grow the fuck up and accept the corruption and undermining of democracy that has been going on
0|He is a handsome guy, but trying to characterize someone by the way they look is more of an American thing to do.
1|Well we all know that the FBI will just say that they didn't mean to and they can't prove intent anyways ... so move along folks
1|Dude the email megathread wasn't needed, it was suppressing us
1|I can't understand how Bernie supporters would be upset that the party of equality deliberately made the primaries unequal.

0|"""Do I look like a criminal mastermind to you?"""
1|Yeah FUCK HER for having a dry throat!

0|Goddamn that was brilliant.
1|Pass that puppy before the supposed TPP opposer gets voted in!
1|Pointing out that a woman is lying is sexist
0|What makes you think doing away with corporate personhood would do that?
0|Obama wasn't in the Senate at the time.
0|So again, they knew the rules.....
0|That must be pretty easy without a spine.
1|Candidates shouldn't be judged on the things they do or say, they should only be judged on how I *feel*.
1|unlike you, they have jobs
0|Why not?

1|Don't worry Trump is a plant put in by Obama so he can suspend the constitution after Trump wins the election
0|As opposed to Trump supporters, who would NEVER EVER resort to such tactics.
1|Oh gee, what a nice moderate Republican he is.
1|I'm sure the Republicans are willing to have a tax increase for programs to help these special needs people who need help though.
1|Having an economy that was 90% oil had nothing to do with it.
1|that 23% are not 10s anyways, I mean, who cares about how fat pigs vote?
1|but, but... he will save us from evil Hillary, who only supports 12$ minimum wage, she is clearly the worst
0|Does that make it ok to give nothing to society while most people are unable to choose the option of paying less?
1|It's true, her views are so bad they gave me cancer
0|If you live in a two story doublewide, are you considered Upper White trash ?

1|But they closed these clinics for women's health.
1|Says who?
0|"No one asked what ""hope and change"" or ""yes we can"" meant either."
0|Yeah the guy who has the most votes of any Republican primary candidate ever is going to lose to the candidate that is currently in the midst of a scandal and has alienated a large chunk of her party.
1|Like Obama, of course!
1|It's about time he started using people who are experts in their field.
1|So Lincoln was a Kremlin bootlicker.
1|Is he often confused by computers?

0|It is well documented that Trump has chosen to orange-face.
1|They claim there are product improvements, like a shorter expiration date so you have to buy them more often.
0|this is probably it.
1|But it's Hillary's turn!
0|Well that's a pretty patronizing thing to say.

1|Probably burn your place to the ground for defacing the flag of The United States of America.
1|You dropped this:
0|Unfortunately similar to Hillary's strategy.
0|Finally someone is willing to ask the important questions
1|Yeah what's the big deal!
0|Maybe the other members of your generation got some wisdom with their age.
1|Thats totally what I said
1|Well, that is the true mark of exceptional, American leadership.

0|I bet you tell people your dick is 12 inches too.
1|"Yeah, but the bible is fact and science is just a bunch of guesses aka ""theories""."
1|Yeah because Infowars and Alex Jones are just the most reputable journalists
1|"Yeah, I forgot Trump isn't quite as much of an ""independent."""
0|And yet nobody on either side of the aisle has anything negative to say about Comey and Obama himself put Comey at the head of the FBI.
1|Young people it's not like they were going to vote Dem anyways
1|Yeah, there's a real lack of people willing to attack Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump around here.
1|She'll look into it
1|Nah dude them the rules of the party too bad so sad
1|How dare you not take my anecdotal evidence as gospel!

1|And he's got s bridge to sell you
1|Ann Couter is in tears.
1|Which is not at all why he said it
0|Trump doesnt drink
1|Yeah, because martial law, political uncertainty and suspension of legal protections are totally known to solve everything, right?
1|Who wouldn't want to emulate those nations?
1|Yeah I bet CNN will cover every minute of it
1|No you obviously don't understand, despite the fact that Sanders is down millions of votes and hundreds of delegates, it's unfair that the drafting committee reflect this disparity.
1|I think he forgot the
1|Just wait for the debates, everyone will be convinced he's the right candidate.
0|It hinges on the superdelegates not actually voting for another four weeks or so and there being an investigation currently underway which has never been a factor before.
1|He's just tellin' it like it is!
0|That's also a terrible idea but it doesn't change the fact that Trump doesn't actually stand for anything except stupid shit like building a wall which will do very little to actually solve the problem.

1|Right, cause the establishment is in it for Trump.
1|It's all rigged!
0|Yep, fucking with me.

0|Also they used a 6 year old child for the 400th but didn't mention it.
1|Well women are only there on the arms of Bernie bros, not actually supporting Bernie so atleast they gave our Bernie Bros girls a name
1|Oh yeah no Democrats at all voted for Sanders
1|I've never known a Republican that didn't have one black friend.
1|Everyone else did it why can't she?
1|Yeah because the well informed totally think 5% year over year gdp growth is a 1) achievable and 2) a good thing
1|But Bernie hasn't been negatively attacked, repeatedly by David Brock and his minions.....
1|Makes it so much better
1|What an edgy and unpopular opinion to have Gary

1|They should just re-release Reefer Madness
1|But... but crowd sizes, shit polls, ashamed voters and podesta emails.
0|Well, at least he didnt said she was ugly this time...
1|Shes just an object anyway, whats the big deal?
1|Corey Lewendowski showed it is OK, because he was never charged.
0|Be that as it may, he fucking said he had evidence to disprove the claims and it would be released shortly.
1|Such a nasty man.
1|But she's blonde and comely and doesn't look like a toad like Stone or Ailes do, she couldn't possibly be evil!
1|What you are saying is madness, MADNESS I TELL YOU.

1|Yeah sorry the true progressives imagined something even better so Iraq is our fault
0|By musket I think he means AR-15.
1|We are so fortunate to have Trump fighting through those painful bone spurs (which forced him to defer military service) lecture the former dean of the Army War College about military strategy.
1|Another hard hitting journalistic pearl from DN
0|That's not how the justice system works....
1|But he earned that money out of his own pocket unlike crooked Hilary
1|Unlike Trump, who has absolutely zero ties to Russia
1|"Inb4 ""Economy measures rigged to make Obama look good before election"""
1|Wow 2.9% wow that's explosive
1|Yeah, because fluctuations in the stock market aren't common at all.
1|Well, they litter pot containers...
1|60 votes to repeal obamacare is a great use of our tax dollars.
1|I bet it's about yoga!
1|But that only leaves PutinNews and Breitbart!
1|Glad there's both representations of aruements in this subreddit :)))
1|Yeah, the election itself sucks just because one of the candidates did so much shit that even with all her money and protected status FBI had to reopen her case.
1|Innocent until proven guilty is just a phrase
0|If Hillary can pull this off in a week she is a God dam baby Einstein.... just saying.
0|I assure you we're all doing this on our own volition since we hate Trump that much
0|you would not want to serve under Clinton, she would ship your ass out if you were still active duty.
1|But Bernie lost fair and square right guys?
0|you know how it goes, if i feel it, its real
0|I could start my own wikileaks if it bothered me.
1|You forgot the
0|Well, we all know Putin likes Trump
0|Reality has a stubborn liberal bias of finding her innocent of everything thrown at her...
0|What like North Korea?
0|Oh I'm sorry do you have evidence that Trump got literally anything from his donation?
0|it would/will be Hannity.
0|Remind me, wasn't this the most transparent presidency ever?
0|Well, there's been no charges of broken laws, so...
0|Relax, I've been called CTR several times in the past few days, and the comrades haven't been banned.
0|Goldwater was fairly racist and was their presidential candidate in 1964.
0|Sorry what national politician is known to the average person?
0|That seems awfully arbitrary
0|He pulled out a gun and started shooting people after the semi got stuck.
0|The pandering...its so strong.
0|And this joke is just as funny after two months use :D
0|Because we have the best universities and train the best doctors.
0|It's IRFRA, not to be confused with the federal law.
0|Yeah, except your post history is a dead giveaway.
0|That's weird I havnt heard anything about those two in the past two weeks

1|This was sometime after Obama forged his US birth certificate and college grades.
0|"You know there's an area between the extremes of ""Everything is socially acceptable"" and ""thought police dystopia""."
0|Is it possible that the FBI is letting the Clinton camp run with its No Evidence, No Problem narrative completely uncontested, in order to lull them into complacency?
1|Happened during the 2008 election, although that was different, because Obama isn't always a victim of mainstream media while Bernie is.
0|Yeah, she lost a lot of my trust.
0|And as people figure out who he is, they will show even less enthusiasm.
0|He's personally liable for $265 million?
0|Why cant we worry about America first
0|Only a fucking idiot would believe that Clinton didn't intentionally mislead the public.
0|you have 0 understanding of the law
0|big surprise.
0|i'm still waiting on sanders to do a comeback and win the a seat in the general election like all the sanders supporters on reddit having been claiming for months was about to happen

0|I'd fully support arming every American if they were subject to the same training and background checks as Secret Service officers before being allowed to carry.

0|Retroactively classified.
0|Only now that he's starting courting big money donors whom he claims buy candidates.
0|Call it popular democratic representation then.
0|Cheeto Benito
0|All you hear on reddit is the muffled sounds of Bernie's cock in berniebros mouths
0|So you are saying that it's ok to punish people for crimes the MIGHT commit but have not committed?
0|It wasn't too long ago that Virginia was considered a safe red state that voted for Bush twice.
0|Just curious, what's some other good popes of other centuries?
0|"Why is it being called an ""interview"" vs what it actually was: the interrogation of the suspect in a criminal investigation."
1|what a wonderful user history
0|If this guy doesn't pick it up, I swear to God this'll be my novelty account.
1|You expect them to walk like common riffraff?
0|I know this will be buried, but if they make this work, I may just move there.
0|"Yeah, and try explaining how it works and I get ""But I'm just one vote, it's not going to matter anyway""."
0|Probably right and had she kept sticking that head of hers under there while pressing the button marked Hot Water...she would have been in for a surprise!
0|No, you

1|Guilty until proven innocent!
0|Shh, people don't want to hear logic here.
0|I can actually remember a time when being this out of sync with reality could get you a 72 hour psych eval.
0|Doubling down on the Jewish star comments today was ludicrous, he cannot admit he is wrong and only makes things worse for himself like he did with Curiel he is either a moron or a plant.
0|Krombopulos in season 3?
1|Because it worked so well for John McCain.
0|I'm convinced half these people are Trump supporters pretending to be liberals.
0|When people stop interpreting things based on their own biases and prejudices.
0|DeBlasio is turning out to be a real dickweed.
0|exactly
1|BUT ITS A SECURITY REVIEW DAMMIT!
0|Where all the white women at?
0|Only if you are royalty.
0|If Trump is elected you can assume that every aide involved would have their security clearance stripped at the very least.
0|If 538's general election predictions are as accurate as they were in the GOP primary then she *should* be terrified.
1|Lol lots more wars yay lol.
0|No, not nearly half.
0|Oh no they're gonna kill us all omg privacy why would we allow it omg
0|"It certainly won't be Hillary she's ""easily confused"" and ""not sophisticated enough"" according to Comey."
0|So you actually believe Fox News intentionally made up a bullshit poll?
0|Might be headline of the year, out of many strong contenders.
0|Which will be mathematically irrelevant.
0|Because a phone call involving the Attorney General involves a record that a phone call took place on a call log that can be subject to FOIA.
0|Just like we said about Bush, and look how that turned out.
0|Sad
0|No thanks.
1|B-b-but the attacks from the right and left are *exactly the same*
0|Poor Trumpettes only have their conspiracies left to cling to.
1|Yes, he failed them, he has to go.
0|All it shows is that the Russians are doing better things for America than the Democrats.
0|This is priceless.
0|I do, I would say he lines up with me politically
0|Doesn't he have a great relationship with the blacks?
1|How dare Bernie for not bending a knee to the all-mighty dollar!
1|The lack of support of the youth couldn't be because she is a flawed candidate.
0|They aren't Republicans

0|It's this the new new thing?
1|I blew mine on paying for more $hills, gotta really exemplify the  imwithher lifestyle
0|Of course, when our government ships so many of these manufacturers' products to 3rd world countries with corrupt governments themselves, that then turn those weapons on their civilian populations, maybe they **should** get tort immunity.
0|Like Burritoghazi?
1|Bill could just email her the records from the briefings.
0|Why vote on him, when they can just, you know, *not*
1|Vote Hillary, because Trump is worse!
0|If you make businesses pay more tax and then pay higher wages while paying higher premiums for insurance how does this help?
0|Insulting people personally with ad hominem attacks shouldn't be allowed, you're contributing nothing to the convo by doing so.
0|Because when the scorecard is hundreds of anti-Clinton articles (which many are pure crap) to single digits pro, people realize the sub has a incredible bias and call other people out on it.
0|And at this rate they will put him in because they are not winning the election.
0|Based on......?
0|Are you denying the existence of CTR?
0|*affect
0|No exit polls and all that huge pile of provisional ballots, uncounted.
0|Did you miss the part where the director started that between 2 and 10 people had access to classified material, including 2 of her sys admins that had no security clearance.
1|Totally makes her qualified to be POTUS
1|Because abuse victims never defend their abusers
1|"Yeah after all the leftists downvote what they disagree is when ""the truth"" is shown."
0|I see lots of war and strife when I look at her
0|Jizz
0|Trump will win Florida because of this.
0|Do go on...
0|And why is that?
1|Only white people can commit hate crimes, now get with this admistrations narrative or I'll charge you with a hate crime.
0|Source?
1|but it's not an endorsement and bernie is still in the race
1|But Trump won the Nevada primary by a lot!
0|Yeah, the fact that they didn't doesn't give them any moral high ground though.
0|He said that we need to have law and order...that's it for right now.
0|I'm sure he'll do that at the debates.
0|I bet John Boehner is in Florida right now, laughing his ass off at what this race has become and thanking god he got out before Trump became the possible nominee.
0|Is accusing her of killing people supposed to contribute to our national dialogue?
1|Now that you think about it, it makes sense!
0|What stops Assange or anyone who had info earlier from deleting, adding or editing information?
0|Like the right to run for public office?
0|No, it won't.
0|Considering Obama just took executive action on GMO labeling, and the official democratic party platform does not list nuclear energy; I'm thinking of the right party.
0|Cool
0|I don't want another Reagan and an even more bloated military.
0|According to many MSM reports, there are no links revealed in the 28 pages between Saudi royal family and the 9/11 hijackers... seriously fuck the MSM...
1|But we don't agree with their speech so they're literally Hitler
0|New to this?
0|Those who control the present control the past, those who control the past control the future.
1|I too enjoy supporting a politician based on their attractiveness
1|Stop correcting the record!
0|I thought Ron Paul won.
0|Or maybe we refuse to vote for a pathological liar?
0|Still a 10 point lead for Clinton.
1|If Trump wins its not on me for not supporting the only viable alternative, it's on them because.
0|You're right, he should be scooping up the water with his bare hands and putting it in buckets...
0|I like the op-ed where he says smoking doesn't cause cancer.
1|A Clinton pledge is worth a lot
1|Clearly their imprisonment was ok since it stopped those young black males from potentially committing crimes!
0|God I love when the left cannibalizes itself.
1|The polling is fine, you just have to unskew it.
0|"Isn't this just called ""Brown-Backing""?"
1|Yeah, if reddit is known for anything, it's a hotbed of BLM support.
1|Right, because ICE certainly never fucks up and deports a brown person just because they weren't carrying 3 different kinds of papers that day.
1|Yep, this is how I feel about Trump supporters.
0|Extremely well said.
0|Says the guy with shit taste in movies and series as their name.
0|Pretty vile comment there.
0|Well they aren't exactly the sharpest crayons in the box.
0|Because people dont upvote megathreads.
0|Since when is something everyone does front page news?
1|She's republican obviously she's a nut job!
1|The right to speak muh mind w/out anyone calling me the racist word
0|Superdelegates count double for Bernie
0|Considering what the rest of their platform looks like, this is like finding a real half-dollar in a stack of poisoned chocolate coins.
0|Good thing he won't be endorsing Trump then
0|No one is saying that Obama took no jabs at Clinton during the WHCD.
1|Maybe they just like guns and are expressing their right to conceal and carry.
1|You mean, just like they did with the Bush Administration?
1|Oh yeah, because that's *totally* what I'm doing.
0|You realize this article was written by Jennifer Rubin who is anything but liberal.
0|Surprised to not see Tim Kaine on the list.
1|Bernie is a prime example of that
1|B-b-but only Hillary would need to Correct the Record!
1|Ron Paul, yeah I remember him, he was a real anarchist he was,
0|Wait, are we talking about Clinton or Trump?
0|How utterly unconvincing.
0|Given the convention bounce in the polls still has trump at a marginal disadvantage, this is not good news for Trump
0|Record status: CORRECTED
0|Or a stroke.
1|Mighty white, mighty white
1|But Trump isn't a fascist!
1|Go big orange!
0|I mean to say that most of the Muslims outside of the Middle East are no better than the ones in the Middle East.
0|People said nothing was going to happen to Bill Cosby too.
0|But it won't save him from the heat death of the universe.
0|She's only gotten better under Obama with all the chaos from the ongoing silent and background wars.
0|And they won't do the same exact thing next election because...?
0|I think Rick Sanchez, of Rick and Morty
1|We know this because she was indicted.
1|you forgot the
0|Same if you replace Trump with Hillary.
1|Ssh let the poor child talk, its not his fault his abusive father punched him as a fetus...

1|Yea, but CTR...
1|But but but OHIO!
1|Why don't they ever go after Crooked Hillary!
1|Don't you watch Law and Order?
1|Because the terrorist attacks are *Shillary's* way of deflecting!
0|"""Big D"""
0|I honestly don't think they care at this point.
0|Well, people will say what others want to get into power.
0|I've seen people in other threads point fingers at him.

0|Look at his username - it checks out.
0|Panthers facing off with bikers and no violence.
0|Can you name some of the notable ones...just curious.
0|What gave it away?
0|The Democrats are just pissed off that Russia conclusively demonstrated Obama's support of terrorists and terrorism in Syria.
1|I feel so sorry for her.
0|I assumed that's what was happening?
1|Yeah why'd you do that, stupid?
1|Yea, that never happened before!
1|Hey Everybody, Hillary's having a press conference today at 2pm to clear up this and the FBI issue.
0|I hate defending him, but i think he forgave those loans.
0|Volunteering to protect the country is different than volunteering to be put in some dangerous bullshit No Fly Zone that Hillary is heavily advocated for despite the Military warning her that it's ineffective and dangerous.
1|Watch your tone!
0|Possibly, but his record has been pretty firmly centrist.
0|I don't think that either of them would do what HRC did, so this is an irrelevant conversation given what this is in reference to
1|I Bet reddit gold that he will thoughtfully and eloquently answer the question regarding his willingness to commit war crimes by specifically and purposefully targeting and killing non-combatants and civilians on the battlefield.
1|Right, because that's all Democrats major in.
0|If easily vote kasich over hillary, and liberals call me communist Bernie or Jill Stein 2016
0|538 also has two models with each one predicting a different winner, which allows him to say he was right no matter which way it goes.
0|The time traveler was Ted Cruz
0|yes that is a semantic rebuttal to what i said
0|sounds like nominating Hillary was a *collosal mistake*, amirite?
1|Yes they are subhuman.
0|I've been replying to comments with every amount of sarcasm today I can't tell anymore
0|O'malley votes
1|Psh, everyone knows the New York Times is controlled by evil Russians.
0|That, and shit just got a *lot* more serious for Clinton.
0|it was an non issues until sander's supporters made it an issues.. and don't tell me they didn't, unless you're blind from that 1000x daily posts in /politics
0|The lack of open primaries is the biggest issue in the sanders campaign, i would imagine at least 100,000 votes were lost for him in new york
1|"I can jut feel the Fox News ""love"" for Sanders"
0|*Ding ding ding* four more years of nothing getting done.
0|"I am not a lawyer but I would say that is a good time to develop amnesia or to refuse to answer and be happy with a charge of contempt of court and the ""safety"" of the jail."

1|He's just being modest and doesn't want to brag about his charitable contributions!
1|NO its your fault for not taking bills throbbing member down your esophagus!
1|Because white people are evil, obviously.
0|And New York!
0|If the Democrats take the Senate and Republicans filibuster a SCOTUS nominee, expect the Democrats to abolish the filibuster for that as well.

0|He was much closer than she expected
1|some should tell him that he forgot the
0|Trump's treatment of the Khan's and the death of their son makes me wonder how, if he was President, he would handle the phone calls he would have to make to the parents of American soldiers who were lost in conflicts.

0|The patriot act and privacy has nothing to do with net neutrality.
1|He didn't defraud people, only darkies
0|Tell that to CNN's fucking panels every night.
1|Yeah man, Trump is gonna take out that CNN.
1|smh liberals always wanna talk about facts, facts don't matter
0|Interesting they decided to add a bunch of wifi hotspots last night for all the sections with lots of Bernie supporters, pointing directly over sections, which wouldn't make any sense for what would be, based on those videos, an omnidirectional wifi antenna.
0|Yeah If she wanted to be president I would do everything in my power as her mother to keep her honest.
1|Yeah I'm glad she's finally coming around on that one
0|Roaches be roachin
0|You mean when she was a baby?
0|Because *she* want's to torture prisoners and murder their families?
1|This is the person we want holding the nuclear launch codes.
1|That's right people, if you don't believe Hillary murdered multiple people you're just a CTR shill!
1|Yeah guys, let's vote for who foreigners think it's best
0|This is a crime...
1|And don't you losers try to infringe on our first amendment rights with your pathetic disagreement and criticism.
1|But...but...I thought a corporation was an individual.
0|I believe he's talking about the Bernie or Bust crowd, not the general crowd who voted for Sanders in their primary.
1|But then how will we charge a poll tax?
1|But not donating to Trump is the same as donating to Hillary.
1|But but he's just saying that to cover up th massive Russian conspiracy that he is a part of
1|There's absolutely no bias in this study because it was done by objective Bernie Sanders supporters
0|Hollywood have done this many times before, pretty interesting even if it's only a crackpot conspiracy theory.
1|Sure Wikileaks, the poll is legit...
0|Nah he has plenty of excess blood due to his minuscule hands.
0|I predict that before November Trump will claim he's got cancer or had a heart attack and drop out.
1|Thank you for this hard hitting journalism.
1|Oh... right, because the Clinton foundation scandal, Uranium one, and her private email server are all way in the past... How could i have been so blind.
0|Thank you!
1|I love it when John Oliver discusses WikiLeaks
1|Maybe he's playing 4D chess and we can't see it.

1|Good thing they tested if it would kill all life on earth, what if it actually did?
0|Seems a bit of 'ethical hairsplitting'... reminiscence of 'It depends on what the meaning of is is' for those of you that remember the innocent days of the Slick Willie shenanigans...
1|How do we know she's not a secret muslim jihadist infiltrator then?
0|Only convenient if the booze and pills kick in before any kind of penetration occurs.
1|I feel triggered
1|But she wore a white dress at the RNC... THE PATRIARCHY!
1|Just like Obama caused the war in 2008 you mean?
0|Aren't Republicans supposed to be all about original intent?
1|Crap, ten dollars!
1|Right, the same way she hates Obama.
0|Like Clinton and her supporters, hopefully
1|But it worked for Iceland.
0|The only reason I am voting for Clinton is to keep the nuclear codes out of Trumps hands.
0|If Due Process and other Constitutional rights are a problem for you, you probably shouldn't be a US Senator.

1|Yeah, I remember when Hitler wanted to build a wall around Poland too
1|Well, vaccines cause autism so I'm glad we aren't funding that.
0|Complete idiot confirmed
1|He's right, the definition is sarcasm is repeatedly lying and exaggerating to multiple sources, and then abandoning the rhetoric when it starts to work against you
1|Absolutely terrible, if he can pay for these riff-raft to do things then there are still taxes that can be cut.
0|what edit?
1|It won't effect him because the election is rigged!

0|I wish this would actually happen
1|Please racism and discrimination don't exist, it's some PC culture narrative.

1|Obviously nothing could be HIS fault.
0|"Give an example of something that sounds ""crazy"" when put in proper context."
1|Maybe he could ask Obama to disband it.
0|Those poor people who are just trying to get their Ultraballs.
0|The Clinton he is referring to is Bill
1|"""It was an inside job"""
0|Nah, just truth.
1|He's right, because obviously 9/11 was a false flag perpetrated by the Bush Whitehouse to sell a war no one wanted to get Cheney rich.
1|Hey hey - apparently wikipedia now labels him as 'described as a conspiracy theorist'
1|Never trust anyone who wears wooden shoes!
1|Obama apparently, spends all his time hatching and executing evil plans that thwart the plans of true, patriotic Americans.
1|HIGH ENERGY, FELLOW CENTIPEDE!

1|I am thoroughly disappointed in trump.
1|Yeah but you're not FBI or DOJ so your opinion doesn't matter
1|But I thought Trumpetes hated safe spaces!
1|It's all just a game of 362D Bingo!
1|I think you missed the
0|Trump is back, poll numbers fuck those stats, WaPo can't stop with their unfair attacks.
1|Which polls?
1|It's like when Kenya intervened in the election to make Obama president.
0|Leftists: Donald's debt is bad, increasing the Government's debt is good!
1|I bet Obama himself took a comically large sack of cash with a money sign on it and give it to his Islamist brothers over there.
1|Well you can't just go *giving* things to poor people or they'll never get jobs, right?
1|Unskew those polls!
1|Didn't you read -- he watched the whole thing!
0|It makes me fucking sick that people are defending him still.
0|Wel yea, it's easy when it's just words that you aren't held accountable for, can't wait to see all those robust changes when she gets in office...
1|Clearly MSNBC is the racist network and a two second clip of KFC couldn't have been unintentional.
1|"What about ""I would raise the minimum wage"" doesn't exonerate him from being a xenophobic, racist and sexist?"
1|How can you vote for someone who personally killed Vince Foster?
1|"Keep pushing that ""liberals are covering up refugee crimes to keep racists from being proved right"" narrative."
1|Why, do you really think a sick person could open a jar of pickles?
1|But, but Republicans freed the slaves!
0|Yeah
0|Lemme know when he breaks 1500 delegates
0|"""I wasn't angry at you until you told me to calm down!"""
1|And we all know there's nothing useful they could do, so why bother employing them at all?
1|But all Republicans are still evil mouth breathers
1|Tell it girl, an unbiased media is so overrated.
0|I'm already sick of hearing how Hillary will take our guns and she hasn't even won yet.
1|But anyone that criticizes Bernie is a Hillary shill!
1|Careful before you get someone crying that you aren't uniting the party, or if you continue with that line of talk they'll vote for Trump.
1|Clearly Toddlers are the problem here.
0|Taxes aren't punishment.
0|regularly flip flopping on just about every issue *IS* a type of consistency I suppose.
0|And Bill has already left enough stains on the White House.
0|"It's hard to say she isn't playing the ""woman card"" when she frequently invokes her gender as a qualification in her debate answers and during campaigning."
1|I refuse to believe it.
0|I think that is a tiny tiny part of the problem in the national health care issue, but I guess it could be a much bigger problem in certain local areas.
0|I thought she declined the town hall.
1|All countries matter
1|Yup...Trump is certainly to the left of Hillary
0|nah... if the software could intentionally overwrite something based on how horribly pathetic it is... it would have over written Hillary Clinton a long time ago.
1|nothing to see here... move along like good children
1|What's a middle class?
0|Then you realize you probably should've gotten stitches... Have we killed this metaphor yet?
1|Because all countries with single-payer healthcare and higher education end up like Venezuela.
0|That the truth is out there
0|This horse manure originated with a blog run by an ultimate frisbee whack-job named Frank Huguenard.
1|Haha, you missed the
0|It works well for their level of reading comprehension.
0|or, you know, even having a platform.
1|It will shoot to the top like a rocket.
0|What do you think?
1|Just like we can refrain people who's jobs were lost to free trade!
1|Hey on a long enough scale the companies that destroy the earth go out of business!
0|Yeah but there's gold in them thar hills
1|Wall Street Journal's Market Watch reporting on important market news for investors.
1|Well he said he was going to give a bunch of Americans jobs again.
1|You forgot your
1|Lol yeah, that was really the general sentiment when we had the choice of an upstanding, amazingly well-spoken Senator who would be the first black president we ever had or the decorated war veteran who had an outstanding history of cooperation in the Senate in 2008
1|You forgot your
0|I hope so but I have become cynical about our government holding elitists to the same laws us plebs are bound by.
1|The one she helped write was definitely better.
1|But but, Hillary is a progressive that likes to get stuff done!
1|It's important to follow someone that is capable of leading, even if they are leading you to a place you don't wanna go.
0|His tax plan is stated on his website, hasn't changed since its inception.
1|Yeah, that definitely sounds like something Bernie would agree to.
0|You mean you vomited a little in your mouth or you are emotional with happiness?
1|Because impeaching Clinton sure neutered him!
0|As an IT technician, I trust no one.
1|Sorry California, you shouldn't even bother turning up to vote, your vote won't count because we have already coronated our queen Hillary
0|ABC (Kimmel's network) was among those who offered to host it.
0|I'm just gonna say I think you're being a little fast and loose with that word.
1|He's going to finish this race with only something to like 45-48% of delegates against the most famous woman on the planet so I guess he's a total fucking loser, right?
1|Oh because historically polls have always been the way elections really go.
1|But the questions will be so fair and balanced!
0|This is the kind of ''liberal'' Clinton attracts
0|TPP is a big problem, both short term and long term.
1|Ah yes that's why conservative opinion is so well regarded here
1|Your forgot
1|Obviously it's their fault, the left has been in power for decades.
0|Just because a server is hacked doesn't necessarily mean that person downloaded any information from it.
0|You want him to win because you believe in democracy even with Clinton having 2+ million more common votes than him?
1|Pandering to those low-information voters
1|That's because it's a nothing burger.
1|It wasn't perjury, she was just mistaken
1|That's why I hate ghostbusters!
1|Yeah, who can stand 74 months of steady job growth?
0|They brought him to heel?
1|I get all my news from CNN and MSNBC so I'm much more accurately informed than the average redditor.
1|Or has he pulled out his inner Xanatos and was planning for this all along?
1|Congrats to HRC for having the foresight to not launch Clinton U.... Now I'll vote Clinton
0|So brave
1|It's a security inquiry.... not an investigation.
1|If only they had murdered more people, maybe communism would have worked this time!
1|Bernie is obviously just a CTR shill.
1|Even if we could, that's sexist!
1|That must be why Trump would have never been captured like that loser McCain.
1|I hope you dropped this:
1|Well, she is female, but I'm not sure how that matters.
1|Yes, the problem with this sub is Clinton spam
1|Jerry Brown is obviously a shill and a DINO
1|Lack of transparency is just what I look for in a president.
1|Is it such a bad thing to help out folks who were kind to you?
1|Yes, take power away from governments and give it all to the corporations and oligarchs, they are the real bastions of virtue in the world!
1|Hillary is pro-net neutrality.
1|so Monopolies always are best for consumers/citizens
0|It's fairly evident she was acting extremely negligently
1|It's not like people have lost their jobs over smaller things
0|Because the next politician will do it for $3.5 million.
1|Don't worry, then they can fill out provisional ballots
1|Nah, dude she's totally a psychopath.
1|"Of course not, it's ""the will of the people"""
1|Slow news day, great time to release this.
1|I thought it was just a security review?
1|Well, the media sure pushed that story.. what a surprise!
1|Its always a good idea to wait til the last moment.
1|Yeah, because everything happens in its own individual bubble.
0|What revolution lol you fuckin scrub
1|well if Conservative mouthpiece and FauxNews former Judge Napolitano (who has zero inside informations) says it then it must be true.
1|250 latinas in Miami; that's a large number.
1|America's true hero.
0|If she were a true Reddit progressive, she'd support Trump or Johnson
1|Only if you identify as male
1|Nothing to see in the server scrapings - just yoga schedules and recipes for Arkansas pudding pie for Chelsea's wedding
1|Yeah I never see any negative articles written about Clinton.
1|BUT IT'S HISTORICAL!
0|I'm a social liberal but I don't understand why I can't protect myself from criminals?
1|I bet all those people who endured kidnapping, torture and detention without trial for over a decade really appreciate the efforts of the Noble prize winner.
1|You stereotyped them all as brown you fucking racist
1|Really bringing out the big guns today aren't we guys
1|We're gonna Make Stadia Great Again!
1|Bernie lost, there's no other explanation
1|You dropped this
1|To the top of  all with you!
1|What he has been doing has been working wonderful hasn't it?
1|Unless of course we ban *that* religion
1|Better than how Trump was congratulating himself after the shooting, right?
1|I know when I go dancing, I really want to be wearing a bulky harness with a large weight of metal on one side of my body.
1|Minority Report man, c'mon!
1|Oh but he and Hillary are the same!
1|But we're gonna go ahead and do the most sensible thing we can think of, blame guns!
0|Good for the tax payers and soldiers or the military contractors?
1|yeah because AR-15 have so many other uses than mass shootings.
1|I am convinced it is an ABC/ Washington post Poll so there would be no bias in that poll would there
0|Redditor for 18 hours.
1|But, but, but it will be Obama's crowning legacy, quite befitting for such a noble corporate politician.
1|Speak for yourself, I as a leftie totally think Trump's tweet is worse than the killing of 50 people
1|Yes the government being able to put you on a list to restrict your rights will never be abused.
0|I also heard babies happen when a pee-pee goes into a vagina.
1|What do you think politics is?
1|Better Sanders using it on a well deserved vacation for him and his family, rather than letting Shillary use it for its legal purpose.
1|"Naw remember as a violent race of subhumans we can hold our own against the ""normals"" and their foreign flags."
1|Well, those cases probably involved minority judges who were biased against Trump.
0|He's British, that's the only reason to hate Trump that much.
1|but...but...but...she's raising so much more money than Donald Trump.
1|With a headline like that, who wouldn't take this article seriously?
0|Lawyer actually.
1|But nobody gives a fuck about the Green Party
0|Hey, Barack Obama did it!
1|You forgot to put
1|That's an awfully Anti-Semitic thing of you to say, Obama
1|Yes, I'm sure the dissolution of the UK as a whole can only be good in the long run
1|Forgot this
0|The huffington post can keep on dreaming.
1|But then how will they save daylight?
1|Yeah, because that's how geopolitics works.
1|Glad somebody's there to correct the record...
0|Said no one ever.
1|"As any good constitutional originalist will tell you, the founders didn't really mean ""well regulated"", and the amendment is up for interpretation."

1|Yes those hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives were totally worth it
1|We did it reddit!
0|I think you stumped him, holy shit.
0|Your economy (or lack of) looks pretty stupid over here tbh fam
1|No, no, the foundation doesn't fly her, her fam, or their friends around the country in private jets.
1|Yeah and Martin O'Malley should be energy secretary
0|I know your being sarcastic, but ya that's how I feel about this election in a nutshell
0|I thought that that's what drove his poll numbers, since the media was focusing on him so much.
1|You forgot the
0|Yeah, people give to charities and at the same time they don't want their tax dollars helping the poors because they want to pick and choose which people are deserving of help because they lack, guess what, empathy.
1|But the Clinton Foundation isn't part of her campaign so it doesn't matter.
1|You poor corroded canadians
1|A good leader wouldn't get caught
1|Right, Beach's they'll start voting Democrat.
1|Its because the weed made ya'll lazy.
1|Nah roads are overrated!
1|OMG I'm shocked
1|Yea cause she hasn't done that already.
1|It's totally cool that he even started to though.
1|Yeah, look at all the charges.
1|Another example of her poor judgement
1|Well, Barack Saddam Hussain Obama Bin Laden is almost done with his term, so we can finally get to the MAGA reconstruction period.
1|Because they are white and white people are discriminated against
1|"oh but he did it all ""secretly"""
1|Yeah the Clinton camp totally forced Republicans to vote for him.
1|Reality is HRC propaganda
0|Well aren't you special.
1|They missed the last debate.
1|Don't you mean November 28th?
1|dammit.
1|But muh English
1|yes, that's what the news does....
1|Trump really missed an opportunity there.
1|Deport him!
0|weve come a long way and apparently a long way still to go
1|Vote 5th Party!
0|This should probably have O'Keefe's name right there in the headline, since he's made it clear that framing people for things they didn't do by taking things out of context and adding in falsehoods on top of it is *literally* his MO.
1|This is very surprising
1|"""Wah wah wah liberals are so mean and taking my freedom because they no longer will accept my racist and sexist bullshit!"""
1|I can't wait for the sequel to the RFRA.
0|Make Americans Grope Again!
1|But surely if it had been a REAL rape, there would have been 100% undeniable evidence available?
1|A woman can't be his opponent, she must obviously be a puppet of the men around her.
1|Hillary Clinton was driving the bus at the time.
1|When considering how to handle the tit-for-tat response to Russian interference in our elections, I wonder if the Obama team is considering hacking and releasing GOP email?
1|Tammy Duckworth should have picked a mother from a more respectable foreign nation, like England.
1|Why would any red blooded god loving American drive one o them electric cars!
1|Dont forget Libya, Syria, Benghazi, ObamaCare, and 9/11!
1|Segregation Now!
1|Yeah seriously, the good leaders do coke.
1|I only want him more now
1|they caught the hacker though so everything is good!
0|I will bet you they won't care.
0|I don't doubt trump having a pussy
1|He is definitely going to win now!
1|"""Get out of here with your arguments of nuance."""
0|"I'm pretty convinced it's like half Russians, a quarter preteens who think it's funny to support the ""meme candidate"" and love being on the ""inside"" of a joke, and a quarter actual Trump supporters who also like being on the ""inside"""
1|Yeah, best to just go home and do nothing now...
1|She clearly doesn't get her dad's humor...
1|No, the primaries were rigged - the general will surely be all above board
1|Nobody told me she was a he god damnit!
1|You can't take him at his word-- that'd be slander.
1|It's really unfair.
0|Nah to be consistent they should force everyone to donate tissue and organs to save another potential life.

1|Here, take this:
1|What is morality?
1|But the GOP constituency isn't at all racist.
1|They didn't deserve it, apparently.
1|Uh huh.. you've solved it... we all got instantly flipped by astroturfing... if only we could all be awake like you.
1|I wonder what his position on it is?
1|How did Clinton put them up to this?
1|No no, you are the racist for seeing the inference.
1|But that's because everybody knows that the men are really running the show.
1|Because this article is about him running for president.
1|I forgot the
1|that must be why sanders endorsed trump!
1|this time its gonna happen!
1|And she's a 2 out of 10
1|Clearly this insanely rich woman who is regularly on television is only saying this for money or attention.
1|Global Democratic Propaganda
1|I trust Trump will still praise the FBI should it find nothing of significance in the emails.
0|Also, soybean exports.
1|you forgot the
0|"Could you imagine the reaction on the right if a Democratic politician supported Putin's ""strong leadership style""?"
0|So Hillarys supporting trump now?
1|Clearly the poll is rigged/fixed.
1|But the polls are tightening!
0|Let them have their dreams so you can have your schadenfreude.
1|I think he or she forgot this:
0|when I worked in a national laboratory us engineers would get about 100-200 emails a day and managers on up would get 300+ a good portion of our day was reading email chains.
1|Just like her
1|"But the Clinton Foundation has the word ""Clinton"" in it, so it all evens out."
0|man CTR is slacking today, how did this get to 70 upvotes

0|Ah, you are correct, I had forgotten he made his acceptance speech already.
1|If Obama wasn't so uppity with his veto, Congress would have to put him back in line.
0|that's not true, there are many videos of minorities getting screamed at by anti trump people for supporting the wall

0|Thanks for the comment!
0|So, no?
0|Seems he should be hammering Sanders then, to ensure he isn't nominated
0|Alt-left isnt a thing.
0|Especially when there are meaningful alternatives like bounties or public IP buyouts, but that's requires nuance so let's enact price controls!
0|huh, never heard that nickname for New Hyde Park, NY, before oh well, corruption of the blood is totally something this country was built on and is a hugely popular idea, so pretty please keep sharing your opinion on this and letting people know you're a representative Trump supporter as much as you can before November

0|Unless you're in the top 50% of earners you're not paying net taxes.
1|That's your opinion
1|Considering JEB is always sad maybe this is an omen that Trump is going to win
1|I'm sure Hillary is loosing so much sleep about it
0|You ignore the truth all you want but he is a huge hypocrite and thr media didn't go after him for it
0|Wow I thought Celine Dion was the only Canadian I didn't like, but your rant just made me want to high stick myself repeatedly.

1|Nono, we have been assured CtR always identifies as such, they must be real supporters.
1|balanced too.
1|well this is clearly the fault of black people and their racism
0|Thought she was announcing it at 4:30?
0|It's gotten them this far.
0|No they don't - but they believe in a citizens right to be racist if they want to be, and they believe that the free market will punish openly racist business owners since they will hypothetically get less business allowing non racist businesses to out compete them.

0|A lot of clinton supporters seemed to join reddit at the same time recently....
0|Is that how you explain that hideous curly mop and the cunty mug - bad disguise.
1|Not to mention no one has looked into Benghazi nor talked about it.

0|this explains trumps astounding advantage in the white-non-college educated crowd
1|It's Sanders fault.
1|Rigging something is defined by the date the primaries came into existence, ok that makes sense,
0|Wrong.
1|Did you forget this?
1|yeah, the guy who started out by hanging signs with bits of tape with a budget of a few hundered dollars who rose to challenge one of the most powerful people in the world with every possible institution in our ''democracy'' vying against him... soooooo weak...
0|How do you think he planted that birth certificate in Hawaii?
1|He's obviously a southern state

1|"WOW, now that's the kind of repercussions that say ""we understand the seriousness of this situation""."
0|You misspelled all
1|I know right... why can't everyone just speak American for crying out loud!
1|Because Tim Kaine is so representative of the strong progressives that Clinton would appoint to the Supreme Court
0|It's as if people were groomed for this
0|Show me the mainstream source that explicitly says the Russian hack is the source of these leaks
0|You fuck one farm's worth of animals...

1|I dono man but like Sanders was all like endorsing Clinton so i gonna vote trump too stick it to him and her.
0|No wonder Politifact gave Sanders a slew of 'pants on fire' ratings for his speech last night....
0|Was Obama the establishment candidate in 2008?
1|I'm a white straight guy, and racism doesn't scare me!
1|obviously obama will be opening up a mosque in a hidden location since he is a crouching christian hidden muslim.
0|If you are cool with paying more into a fund that is constantly stolen from and most certainly wont be around for you when you reach retirement age, than by all means vote Clinton.
1|They are telling you only about one of them though... But you guys aren't being manipulated.
1|We played the long game with our Reddit accounts but we knew some day that sweet sweet Hillary money would pour in if we were just patient (after supporting Sanders of course).
1|Yeah, going against Clinton in 2008 really ruined Obama's career.
0|Maybe she didn't want to speak.
0|Well this is like two decades before they made it to the White House so no.
1|Thanks, CTR shill.

0|What good would a registry or license do?
0|Some how I fell that globalist and anti-polution both are contradictory to Clinton I may be wrong though.
0|Not the way Hillary runs things.
1|Yeah cause election fraud is of no concern to the voting public,

1|You abolish the IRS of course
0|Thanks for the info, I will look it up and watch it tonight.
0|I've included links to peer reviewed studies that support my claims.
1|And shills for Hillary
1|Of course the primaries weren't rigged either
1|Probably attacking the compound like all the other liberals.
1|Clearly the only solution is to have independent parties compile the code and run it on their own voting machines and you just go to vote at the machines belonging to the guy you trust most, not so different from any other Open Source project...
1|On the other hand, ultranationalist authoritarianism is *definitely* not fascist.
1|Nice, give the KKK guy attention.
0|Probably can't, but a lot of them will vote for the guy who says he can anyway.
1|Because hillary and the media says we do.

1|Truly something to be proud of!
1|*delete your account*
1|Maybe Obama should have focused less on lowering the deficit and more on reducing the debt.
1|She apologized so we can forget about what she said...
1|Oh right, that six-figure Clinton Foundation payment that totally exists and definitely was not an easily discredited scam.
0|Plus 6% from your employer.
1|Those dumb hillary supporters always yelling 'LOCK HIM UP!'
1|Yeah but cruz didn't have a REVOLUTION so it's not the same
1|Only the emails of the DNC hack are important though!
1|It works perfectly fine, you liberals just keep sabotaging the system with your workers rights and demands for healthcare!
1|Yea, it's not like there has been scandal surrounding her time as SoS or anything
0|Because Trump is a unique and present danger to our world and all other issues are on the backburner until we defeat this problem
0|How so?
1|Yeah but Sean Hannity said Trump gets more Facebook likes so he has to be winning, right?
0|"""Public prison"" instead of private"
1|Fund coups against these anti LGBT governments and install a pro gay government

1|Hillary sure does take some brave stances.
1|Yes, because someone like Bernie would be able to build consensus in congress...
1|Isn't Gerrymandering wonderful?
0|Ironic, since your comment commits the same sin.
0|Bill, it's where the cigars go
1|But all my friends care, clearly it matters.

0|Actually Muslims, Christians, and Jews worship the same God.
0|And where is Ja in all of this?
0|This election is going to Clinton in a landslide.
1|They hate him because he's muslim
1|So he's confirming that 9/11 was a domestic plot by Cheney/Bush to drum up support for an otherwise failing presidency?
1|Come on guys, everyone knows Obama was president from 2000 to 2016
0|Can't really vote for Trump.
1|Mexico must be a paradise then!
0|There's also a chance we all get sucked into a black hole tomorrow.
1|They aren't addressing the many people on the internet who can prove $Hillary is a James Bond villain.
1|Yes you can!
0|It really is disturbing how many people are so adamant without even being aware that MLRs (as high as 85% on ACA products) exist.
1|That's why we need single payer, to make sure the government is the monopoly so healthcare will be free for everyone.
1|But, but Obama is evil and only wants to play golf.
0|Maybe for his next campaign manager trump will just tap Putin himself.
1|I'm pleased that Rick Scott has worked so hard in cutting back government spending on litigating unconstitutional laws he's passed, so that he can focus on cutting taxes to the working class by slashing the tax rate for commercial real estate rentals.

0|He's a -a-redditor-, It's not like he has anything else better to live for!
0|"No ""Fuck you"" (you're choice of words) for suggesting OP is throwing away their vote when both the GOP and DNC have both forced our hand to ""get in line"" and choose between Trump and Clinton... Neither of which deserve to preside over our great nation."
0|I read reddit for detailed insight like this
1|Doesn't free speech mean there aren't consequences for what I say?
1|Sic burn on all those bernie bros
1|Or like dodging sniper fire in Bosnia!
1|The record was overcorrected and now we gotta correct it back
1|perhaps if that is that the real Tim Kaine ....the other one was turned into a zombie by Hillary

1|Optimist.
1|You're right, it's their fault the contraception failed.
1|His respect for women is the greatest respect!
1|That's because Trump is literally the spawn of Satan and Hillary is Christ reborn

1|Keep telling yourself that bro
1|TIL; billionaires are exploiting regular people.
1|Yeah, if you get raped, you're weak and don't deserve to be welcomed into the future of this nation!
0|I've got no empathy
1|Well they had to lower standards to help women secede.
1|Finally, someone having the guts to speak their mind about an opposing party.
0|Just because someone who isn't a former President of the US does something bad, doesn't mean we lower bar for standards... Sounds reasonable I would think?
1|Because Democrats are notorious for not pandering to the poo uneducated
0|I don't think you understand the order of the chain of command.
1|Yeah, because justice is either swift or not worth it!
0|"In before someone tries to claim Hillary is the stronger candidate because ""she's winning""."
1|"But.. it's the **""BernieBros""** that are the ones bad at math!"
1|Are you saying that basing your projections off of Google searches isn't a good idea?
1|Bernie needs to bring his supporters to heel!
1|Thanks Obama.
1|But reddit is upset because democrats are deciding who represents the democratic primary That means that is totally logical and in line with the nation rigjt

0|She's too busy cacklebating over our rotting political system.
0|It's partially true, it was her followers who did it.
0|More like 4 months.
0|Funny way to try and spin one of the largest social media trends of the year.

1|Trump is literally hitler!
1|Yea your simplistic comment really boils things down
0|I like this

1|But surely that's impossible!
1|Retroactive
1|How dare you suggest Hillary Clinton is a thinking, feeling person!
1|I knew Obama wasn't really born in the US
1|But it's the media that is unfairly calling Trump racist!
0|How's that working out in States like Maryland?
1|The 'Vote based on quality, not opinion' rule?
0|It doesn't, more people just need to start using, making, and sharing good alternatives.

1|This ballot is too damn long, it would take me all 2 minutes to fill it out!
1|Maybe we should bring Hitler back to life and give him the presidency since both candidates are clearly worse than Hitler.
1|clearly they just respect Bernie too much to attack him
0|It's funny how one of those things is a policy issue and the other one is completely irrelevant
1|Damn Swedes, always raping themselves.
0|"Also: ""Obama is a Rockefeller Republican in blackface."""
1|Yeah, news orgs pay for meaningless polls because they love wasting money.
1|I'm sure Laura Ingraham and the right wing spin machine are truly, truly broken up and concerned for Bernie.
1|Yeah they have lots of Palm trees in Iowa.
0|Thanks for your thoughtful response, Ad hominem aside you didn't answer the question.
1|Yes, Libya was handled really well.
1|Yep, this is the behavior of people I want deciding my country's future.

1|That's real nice.
1|Don't you mean *Delaware*..?
1|Yah he used yahoo mail, known for it's security
0|That's an absurd interpretation of this agreement
0|Yeah they never seem to mention who is beating the dead horse
1|Obviously we should hand them more power so they have even less accountability for their actions!
0|I don't think you grasp what an upset is.
1|Yea that's exactly what I said.
0|All for background checks, but fuck anyone trying to AR's
1|Sorry, the high frequency almost makes it seem like its your job or something... But people definitely don't get paid to feign support for Clinton on the internet.
1|Right, cause Nader's to blame for being a better candidate.
1|Kommandant Trump shall be pleased to see you placed in der catapult und sent back to your land of delicious taco bowls, brown scum.

1|but trump is going to fix the corruption!
1|*cough* Circumventing FOIA *cough* I'm sure the FBI and DOJ would like to play a role in establishing precedent in allowing private servers from here on out, especially when Hillary becomes president.
1|Yeah, I'm sure there's a way to bridge the old, rich, TV watchers and the young, poor, Internet readers.
0|I can't wait to hear Trump talk about all this on Monday.
0|Clinton Aid: Trump just tweeted some bullshit Clinton: Tell him to delete his account *internet splodes*

0|Just as the DNC guys in this video just assassinated their own character.
0|This feels like it should be a federal offense to prevent government from properly functioning...
1|oh no.... what a nightmare... The horror of letting the era of Cruz and Mitch McConnell controlling the senate go to Bernie Sanders.
1|Make sure your red shirt says MAGA!
1|You make a compelling argument, but I think it makes more sense that millions of people are willing to risk a 5 year prison sentence in order to add a single vote
1|Damn Republicans voting against the 13th, 14th and 15th!
1|Which polls?
1|It's all a very bland plot by Gore to get rich.

1|Naaaaaaaaaaaah can't be that.
1|LOL - yeah Bill Clinton was such a terrible president am I right
1|I wonder who is downvoting this story.

1|Fiscal conservatives!
1|Must be why every reputable economist is lining up to back Trump's plans.
0|Better than lying in bed

1|"Wait till you hear the nightmare one... ""Trump pulls off yuuuge upset"""
1|That makes sense...SBRs are baby killers and mortars are totally safe.
1|Hey buddy, fuck you!
0|To be fair, neither could Trump or Hillary.
1|Well, if MSNBC said it happened then it must be true.
1|"I guess there were none of Trump's ""poll watchers"" around to keep things honest."
1|They catch everyone but they only stop the Republicans.

0|How so?
0|Shows bad judgement and complicity with known scam artists.
1|Great username
0|I like your approach, it's pretty reasonable.
0|This would imply he's capable of empathy and has self control.
1|Yeah, framing Comey's actions in perspective is such a hit piece.
0|You're getting played, son.
1|Those poor oppressed peaceful protesters are so abused.
0|US politics are too polarized for that happen.
0|Strong men don't allow themselves to be beaten by a woman.
0|Seriously, this is  politics, post anything from Fox news and it's immediately discounted.
0|I am sure the Koch brothers are going to love TTP being stopped, low-cost labour being stopped and a president who makes more than 200k a year.
0|Shouldn't it be up to the Secret Service what happens to him, not the president?
0|Didn't McConnel even filibuster one of his own bills at one point?
0|Lindsey Graham: crazy AND dishonest

0|When the heel of the government is on your throat, it matters not whether it is the left or the right boot.
0|With a career as long as hers, every interview is a Barbara Walters-esque interview.
0|A review of a recent political biography with implications to current events?
0|only when it's true
0|Nope, I'm just not dumb enough to think a clump of divided cells inside a woman is a baby.
0|If you're one of the people who believes this conspiracy, answer me this question: Why was Clinton winning in all of the national Democratic polls if she was in reality losing?
0|And well over 3 million other people do not have an issue with her.
0|Him and Rkelly if you remember that whole thing.
1|Oh boy, maybe she'll get indicted!
0|Also the stupid cowboy hats
0|Full circle!
0|Did they ever catch that guy in the deshiki?
0|Not if it comes down to super delegates.
0|Yes the leaked emails came from Blumenthol to Clinton, not emails that Clinton sent
0|Win or lose, I'll take the 'under' on profound changes.
0|I never said 65% would be easy, but it is not mathematically impossible as Clinton and the media would have you believe.
0|But how do you rig elections then?
1|Nah definitely Obama coming for mah gunz
1|I am sure he knows more then 90% of scientists who devote their lives to studying this
0|*Crowd roars*
0|Out of all the families in America who should not be in politics, this is family number 1, right above the Kardashians.
0|Apparently they actually targeted Republicans as well.
1|Obviously because if there was an indictment he'd be crushed by Bernie
0|The DNC is going to win this year both for the White House and Congress, but it'll be to Trump's credit more than anyone else's.
1|Because hillary was senator of new york during 9/11!
0|aaaaaannd you are gonna hear every Hillary apologist saying this as a catch all to any evidence Hillary flat out lies in 3...2...1....
0|No, I wrote it just now.
1|You forgot your
1|That was just a chance encounter.
0|Hillary and her campaign are so unlikable, her best chance is to tie herself to Obama.
1|Wow, after only 300 posts about this the past days I had no idea!
1|And if *she* can't figure out what it means and doesn't follow the judge's orders she goes to jail and Trumpkins rejoice and dance a merry jig!
0|And then republicans can call for an overthrow of the federal government if the majority of the nation votes for her and prove how fickle their love of freedom truly is.
0|It'd be the *classiest*, uhkay?
0|See you in controversial guys
0|Trump is basically the kid in class that thinks he's super smart and calls out the teacher and then the teacher just verbally bitch slaps him down and the entire class laughs at him for bothering the teacher
1|No it isn't possible you shill hack sexist that feeds into the oligarchs plan!
0|To circumvent FOIA requests
0|Wow, I thought it would take a little bit longer to get bullshit rationalizations like this.
0|Step one of the plan would be to get the focus off himself and his ridiculous statements, so I doubt it can be done.
0|Middle Management 2016!
0|Internet rando was wrong, you got me!
0|Fox news and Morning joe have been more fair to Bernie Sanders than any of the 'democratic' networks/programs.
0|As long as he wasn't speaking for the campaign in an official capacity, why should it matter?
0|I don't like Clinton, and this statement is likely true, but it's largely irrelevant to her candidacy.
0|How come Sharpton only shows up after blood has been spilled?
0|Her actions of accepting money from the oppressors off set any word she could ever say on the subject.
0|"I saw ""Trumpanzees"" last night and I hope it sticks."
0|Because its blatant and this is a democrat safe space.
0|And yet she is crushing Trump in many polls right now and losing in none so either they are lying here or Trump is so badly behind with Indpenedents it won't matter.
1|The only thing better than one egotistical snot is two egotistical snots...
0|Well, I guess I'll be voting for Gary Johnson if the names you provided check out.
0|Her lead has gotten bigger since the polls have closed...
0|Also 120 years ago, Viceroy Li Hung Chang, the Special Ambassador of the Emperor of China, spent six hours in Philadelphia.
0|It's an American tradition for candidates to show their returns.
0|No, I rarely hurry anywhere...
0|Give Trump more fodder for his speeches
0|Conversely I think we'd be better off if he got a job as a bouncer at a bar.
0|lol, the circlejerk builds consensus, not knowledge.
1|Yeah, but she's my crook!
0|Ah, yes, calling entire areas 'conservative,' and 'bigoted,' especially when Hillary did so well with minority voters (especially black folks)... Log, meet eye.
0|The Clintons had Ben Ghazi killed when he was going to spill the beans on orgy island I think.
1|Because he's got so much more info than the FBI does.
0|It's fine, we still have more ships to send out the Muslims on
0|I'll give my cheesy right to balance things out
0|Bunch of kids using second-hand equipment, sounds about right.
0|20-somethings mostly ignore every election
0|ITT: You getting butt hurt because your arguments are garbage
0|At this point, we're setting the bar pretty low.
0|Votes in November are what matters most.
0|No, just people who commit crimes, and/or evil shameful or wrong acts.
0|Because the Republican party has truely been against nafta and tpp this whole time.
0|So, hypothetically, he's not a job creator?
0|there's no way this was a thing lol
1|Surely this will be her undoing!
0|Libertarians come across as actual conservatives.
0|Drugs aren't self-defense implements.
0|No, they just advocate for violence sometimes.
0|She's the one who started campaigning that Obama was a secret Muslim and wasn't born in the US.
0|Thank you for clarifying that your objection is with gender of the individual, not the activity.
0|"I find it a bit horrifying that Trump supporters seem to consider profiling based on religion somehow ""better"" then profiling based on race."
0|I think the primary made that abundantly clear
0|Pride and greed are two of the deadly sins
1|Well we already had W. Bush.
0|Followed by wiping your servers, with a cloth.
0|Over 8000 submissions in four years is kinda whorish.
0|The early drafts were leaks of classified materials, and by law Clinton could not deliberately look at them.
1|It's just a theory!
1|So excited for her to change her mind once she doesn't have to pander!
1|Pay for it with death of course!
1|dont worry your white privilege will kick in soon
0|So leave.
0|The majority of people don't know what she actually did, I had to explain it to someone who was arguing the other day, they just blindly followed headlines.
0|The study is based on a sample of 10,000 incidences of contact between an officer and a white citizen and an officer and a black citizen

1|It's almost as if entertainment has to detach its self from reality a bit to be entertaining.
0|I don't see how federal rulings can be tyranny of the majority when the rulings come from courts, not a majority of the people.
0|Which is why I don't associate with the Greens, an Anti-Science platform should be left to the Republicans.
0|To be fair, the Republican Party hasn't been the Party of Lincoln since 1964 when the Civil Rights Bill was passed and signed by Lyndon Johnson.
0|Isn't this Friday that that happens?
0|"""People call me up and say 'Donald, you're the biggest loser right now' and then I sue them."""
0|Trump is suppose to endorse Ryan tonight, but who knows.
0|I watched it this morning and that was the best part of the whole show.
0|Would you rather work in an office with a comfortable chair programming apps to sell in Vietnam or work in a sweatshop making coffee mugs to sell in the US?
1|Those two departments cost $30 billion, right?
1|The Clinton foundation is clearly blackmailing her into saying that!
1|Its not meaningless if you intentionally signed it.
1|Thanks Obama!
1|Because what's good for them is what's good for America, dammit!
0|Religious liberty will be being free from people like Michele Bachmann.

0|I know they get shot at by snipers a lot...
0|Trump is surely doomed says increasingly nervous Clinton supporter for the fifth time this month
0|~~The leftwing media industry~~ Trump has made bigotry and divisiveness the cornerstone of Trump's candidacy.
0|Should be an easy victory, unfortunately Hillary Clinton is running against him.
1|Naw...they would **never** do that...
1|I'm still not sure what his endgame is though
0|You're the one who provided the source.
1|And reality doesn't exist because you said so.
1|"""Possible"""
0|The same people that can't recognize that Sanders and Clinton are both progressives on the American political compass.

0|"Boudicca said ""make me!"""
1|But you can't cut the TSA and it's funding from the budget.
0|That's because Putin would eat Trump for breakfast, the Russians want a person who has no clue how to handle foreign policy in power in the US, so they can flex their sphere of influence.
1|deport the mexican that made that ladder too
0|No, but it is more divided than 2008 which was his point
0|Because that's a lie?

0|It was a joke...
0|This sub will never admit it but this speech likely just won Trump the presidency
1|CNN stands for Clinton News Network duh
0|So many people are talking about it
0|Translation: How dare anyone question the Emperor
0|We'll then have Democrat (Obama Clinton wing) and Liberal (Bernie Warren wing) party, as the two party system.
0|I think you have Bernie and Hillary confused.
0|She's got that Mao dictator look going for her.
0|As opposed to this sub?
0|Donald Trump is the victim of truth, facts, and direct quotes.

1|I couldn't imagine that based on your username
0|but but but that wasn't trump
1|Nah mate, the republican head of the FBI was totally threatened at gunpoint on a Tarmac by Loretta Lynch so that doesn't matter.
1|I think you forgot this:

1|My hero.
0|You didn't watch it?
1|False flag!
0|Trump did promise to revise libel laws so he could sue the media and win lots of money, though
1|IT IS HER TURN YOU WHITE MALE
1|That's why we are loved and no one ever attacks us.
0|I'm a Bernie supporter and have contributed to this campaign despite the fact that I disagree with him in regards to illegal immigration and his opposition to nuclear power.
0|A year ago, anyone and everyone would have guessed it would be the other way around
1|Don't worry guys, I'm sure it's just an outlier.

1|"You spelled ""literally Hitler"" wrong"
1|But *a vote not for Hillary is a vote for Trump* remember?

1|Trick questions are not allowed.
1|Is this early news that Sanders is winning big in WV?
1|What, like Pokemon?
1|I'm sure Hillary's AMA would be no holds barred
1|That'll browbeat him into voting for Hillary for sure.
1|But wait till you hear about the GOP campaign, and how Trump obviously will follow it to a T, thereby ruining America and going against the wishes of all after being elected!
0|It depends on how loaded your post was.
0|I think Trump is happy to be called dangerous.

1|Ah, pull yourself up by your boot straps
0|As opposed to Salon, Breitbart, sputniknews and whatever other filth sources hits the frontpage, amirite?
0|I'm talking about the health issues the entire town was having but it was swept underneath the rug because of money and political corruption
0|I guess we never built anything with out illegal aliens huh?
1|Because clearly, the Bush name meant so much to voters when primary time came around
1|Yes... this is what a civil rights lawyer does...
1|Yes, because Elizabeth Warren did so much against Bernie's campaign by refusing to endorse a candidate.
1|What a diverse list of blue collar people that have always been about the worker and against our trade deals.
1|Yeah, because immigration and murder are comparable.

0|Her job is to protect Hillary?
1|Yup, scribd is the source I go to to get the lowdown on politics.
0|Here we go again with the conspiracy theories.
1|Yeah all those things sound like something Bernie Sanders and his supporters would say.
1|I'm sure they're fighting legalization out of the kindness of their hearts, and not because they may lose jobs when they can't lock up everyone they catch smoking.
0|judging by the pages of anti bernie stuff in ur post history, of course u haven't given up on Bernie because you never gave anything worth a damn for him, a staunch Bernie supporter wouldn't have as much anti Bernie post as you do..

0|If she were to get a pardon, I think she would keep right on going with her presidential run like nothing had happened.
1|Yeah, and that's why every one of our white presidents was repeatedly accused of lying about where they were born
1|She didn't know!
0|We have to take this outrage straight to the ballot box and not vote for *establishment* candidates anymore.
1|The most transparent administration.
0|What do you imagine Hillary will do?
0|That's step 2 Step 1: blow up most of the western world Step 2: sell them the stuff to rebuild it Step 3: profit.
1|And  politics is the bastion of open discussion, and totally not an echo chamber
0|Gotta hide all the shit that Berniebros are doing.

1|Your mistake, the editor job in Salon is just to make sure Bernie headlines are coming out, so they get the clicks.

0|Too bad for her she didn't know about the backups when she wiped the server, she's usually much better at making evidence disappear
0|Welcome to Murica, where letting people vote is unconstitutional.
0|So the black guy laughing about it is a racist too here?
0|Rule by TV show.
0|Hell of a plan, let them get rich then attack us, then we don't do anything except cover it up.
0|all they did was try and scare people into voting for hillary by saying over and over that donald was dangerous and going to ruin their children, seriously not a single speech went by where they didn't make it past four sentences before talking about how dark trump's message is.
0|Sure, legally he would have been, but can you honestly not see how that would be acting in bad faith?
1|TPP obviously, she totally won't flip on that again.
1|But that doesn't support my feelings on third party candidates and thus your opinion means nothing.
0|well at least trump didn't have to rig an election to get the nomination.,,
0|Honestly nothing will almost certainly come out of this but it's nice in the fact that its keeping it relevant in the media and exposing Hillary's lying and extreme carelessness
0|Much better candidate, much wow
0|Pander = not insult?
0|Just like Hillarys hopes on becoming president.
0|HRC supporters are awefully bitter themselves for being winners lmao
0|If you think Adderall is bad try taking Focalin...
0|She just did!
0|This is from 2012?
0|People actually believe this?
1|Good comeback...
1|Way to put yourself in their shoes
0|All aboard the Trump train it is then!
0|"What you mean is ""found someone who disagrees with me and this is the only way I can process what they are saying!"""
0|Well said.
0|She's just helping them with their security review and yoga.
0|"But on the bright side she has now given an interview so we can reset the ""no formal interview"" counter back to 0."
0|Lol what a constructive comment.
0|"But don't you see the irony of the fact that by labeling 40% of the country as ""racist"" because they're voting for someone, you're actually a part of fueling polarity as well?"
1|In all fairness, I'm sure she's the least untrustworthy politician in modern times that she knows how to be.
0|Trump supporters don't need to set shit on fire and throw temper tantrums when faced with differing opinions lol
0|Like, with a cloth?
0|Isn't what he's saying the textbook definition of racism?
1|That's sexist!
0|Ailes is negotiating exit terms
0|Metaphor, how does it work?
0|Bill Cosby already accepted under oath that he roofied women.
0|I'm pretty sure the 1880s and 90s were worse.
0|When they could survive without the host.. Outside the womb
0|You're making it obvious that you know near to nothing about US history, law or what rights the constitution actually gives you.
0|I agree, she's toxic, everything she touches turns to sh**.
0|He can just say he was being extremely careless.
0|Source?
0|This is getting sad.
0|Sarah likes to think that she's still relevant but nowadays she just looks Palin comparison.
0|Fuck them both, vote Johnson.
0|I really don't care what Dumb Donald says.
1|I mean if it were a Clinton I'm sure it wouldn't get talked about on reddit or in the news
0|He attacked her when he called her unqualified.
0|Classic Trump, not saying much and letting his supporters fill out the blanks according to their own ideology.
0|Your source is that people were saying it on reddit?
0|That's what Ted Cruz said
1|But she personally killed those people in Benghazi while wearing a necklace made of Vince Foster ears!
0|Ok but he gets out there and lies...
1|You don't understand, it's all about intent to blaze it
0|Do tell which of Trump's policy proposals is about alleviating the struggles of children born into economic hardship?
0|i'm not saying it looks good for him, i'm saying i'd sooner trust them
1|Well like accidents happen right?
0|Stop making up states, theres no such thing as Ohio
0|I think the next step is Clinton Foundation and muh prejury
0|Hell, Im upset that we cant.
0|And people think she should lead this country!
1|The war on drugs makes perfect sense now
0|and that attitude is why people end up believing stupid conspiracy theories and bad history.
1|No, just point the finger at the Republicans
0|Ok, thanks for stopping in.
0|"Associated Press link about a historic presidential speech downvoted to hell to make way for Breitbart articles and blog posts from sites that replace the letter ""s"" with a ""z"" This sub is an absolute cesspool."
0|The ciiiiiiircle of liiiiiife
0|What if I'm anti-blind and anti-orphan but otherwise very liberal, would you vote for me?
1|"Those ""the system is rigged"" attacks are so clever though"
1|Yeah that sounds like something reasonable to hope for.
0|ummm....what?
0|I wouldn't consider being careless with Top Secret: SAP information minor.
0|Both situations involve someone getting fucked over.
1|So, truly an expert.
0|Lol, the projection is reaaaaal.
1|"I'm sure after he ""answers"" all of these questions it will all be put the rest and we will never ever hear anything about it ever again."
0|That doesn't mean they have any use beyond in many instances of policing their own fellow citizens for the leaders.
0|OP is quite mad you know
0|So far I've only seen Trump supporters being beaten while the US flag is being burned.
0|How much you put down?
0|A Beatles concert attendance is well within a football match attendance.
0|It matters greatly, and their unfair advantage would be diminished if they didn't have the laws to keep competition away.
0|They are a figurehead for anything the media want to pin on some sort of right wing donor conspiracy
0|It's like no one here understands how to work in the real world.
0|Okay, right, they didn't actually physically impact him with their foot, you got me.
0|And Washington
0|What if I told you that everyone has thought that through the last 5 elections.
0|Gosh, I wonder what he might talk about in his speech.
0|Lol, just so lacking in ethics that *an association made entirely of lawyers* decided he was too skeevy to associate with.
0|Especially since her husband invented third-way which is, by definition, centrist policies that try to combine aspects of left and right.
0|OK, can someone give me context please ... best I can figure, the whole Pokemon GO real life thing must have happened (I'm just a bit to old to have got into the Pokemon crazy, missed it by about three years I figure).
0|"no, I don't think you viewing the top secret documents as ""silly"" justifies this type of behavior which is at best ""extremely careless"" and at worst, treason."
0|As someone who wasn't on Reddit at the time, was it better, worse, or about the same as the Bernie Revolution here?
0|Are we going to get a transcript of the FBI questioning Hillary?
0|The attorney general and the FBI director need to resign.
0|Eh, still doesn't excuse the fact that 90% of eligible voters don't give a shit about primaries
0|"""Respectfully."""
0|Who?
0|Can lizard people cry?
0|Yep, which is why I think they did correct thing.
0|TL;DR Clinton thinks we're idiots.
0|I'd rather have it from an actual news source.
0|if you aren't yelling you aren't shitposting hard enough
0|If CTR was paying us, wouldn't that mean they were giving Americans jobs?
1|"Yeah Israel really has no idea how to do the whole ""warfare"" thing"
0|Still better than Hillary.
0|When I checked this specific video has not been posted so you're wrong.
1|They should have just called them Commie schools, be proud of who you are Kansas!
0|And by fix, get the hell out of it.
0|Which would still help Clinton.
0|It's either A) a place you go when you're visiting Vegas and want a legal prostitute; or B) where you take a left turn heading to Death Valley.
1|You're part of the Robosexual Agenda... You people make me sick!
0|"""Muslim isn't a race so I am not a racist"""
0|some journalist needs to look into the connections between this sub, salon, and huffpost.
0|What a *maverick*.
0|"Define ""one place"" Like diversity in America is good, right?"
1|Yeah, look at all those guns he's grabbed in the past 7 years!
0|Lol Trump has no chance to win, stop the fear mongering.
0|So how is Bernie campaigning for Trump then?
0|The IRS said they were.. There is nothing to prove.
0|When you 'own' the country you can pretty much do whatever you want....
0|Fox News Channel philosophy.
1|Yeah, the media sure is ignoring her email scandal
1|Something about the quality there is just so attractive.
1|Something Investopedia is k own for.
0|Oh how dreadfully misguided.. he's a CIA asset..
0|What if he says no?
0|Do you even know who David Rothkopf is?
0|Lol what a tool
0|Funny how the establishment watches it's own back
0|That's Trump's job.
1|You're right, net neutrality is terrible
1|Yep I was totally shocked
1|Well obviously sanders supporters should naturally shift their support the Republicans right?
0|Yes we do...please don't flipflop doe
0|yeah but she has a vagina and america needs a vagina as it's next president
1|Forgot your
0|I feel like a father has way more legitimacy than the Republicans.
0|What's very sad is that they already did when they gave Hillary a 99% endorsement advantage before any vote was cast
1|Good thing she has the power to make that happen...
0|And Rubio and Cruz.
0|What, are you triggered too?
0|Well, he's not a democrat.
0|i wish people on this sub would stop shooting down any sort of news or controversy without actually looking into it its **WELL KNOWN** that the DoJ, and the Govt in general, HATES the FoIA and constantly works to kill it its pathetic
1|I'm soooooo shocked
0|Even without agreeing with him, it's hard to say he isn't the most qualified candidate in this election.
1|TPP obviously will solve this!
1|Shocker
1|Oh, well it's all okay then
0|How many times are we gonna hear that same tired refrain, anytime anyone, anywhere criticizes Trump.
0|Because snowball.
1|You wound me, truly.
0|He correctly picked all 50 states' outcomes in 2012.
0|The fact that you're depending on a quota of speakers of color speaks volumes.
0|Ha!..I thought it had already happened some months ago.
0|Thanks Ollie!
0|What truly great and brave Americans.
1|Don't forget the Iraq war too you unpatriotic traitor!
0|you used big, scary words, so...triggered.
1|If he was really for the cause he would be not out there making a difference, he would be talking about voting for a third party or Trump!
0|May I ask what happened?
0|She did really well in the debates with Bernie, and Trump is no Bernie.
1|Woah, that's a totally unbiased statement on Trump's background of being a businessman.
0|Selling his supporters out
1|Yeah the Clinton campaign really needs to control the damage from that one
1|Well all you need to know is they are going to make america great again duh
0|And you're supporting a jag off.
1|Maybe we could go back to leaded gasoline too.
0|You didn't miss your dad?
1|Well they might get some conservative christian vote with Jesus Christ, at least until he starts talking about feeding the poor, sheltering the homeless, and helping those in need.
0|The only way would be for him to do something that required incarceration.
1|Bunch of SJWs know it was her fault anyway for going out dressed like that!
0|Trump didn't ask him to speak.
0|Good to see Politifact back in everyone's good graces.
1|With his Slovenian wife he is some kind of Manchurian Candidate planted to put a soviet-born finger near THE BUTTON!
0|This man has the mental make up of a pre teen girl... what sort of grown man goes around berating others for not voting/liking him.
0|Is he trying to sink Hillary?
0|20 minute silence
0|This is gonna backfire so hard lol
0|Your mother will be so disappointed.
1|I'm sure all those dumbass shooters were active party members who were elected delegates to the democratic convention.
0|I cited my claim and you just came back with that so try harder
0|You must have started late.
1|No, Trump will give them nukes, so it'll be ok.
1|The reason is because Bill Clinton got a blowjob.
1|That'll totally convince those White Supremacist, like David Duke, to not vote for you anymore.
1|He's going to do it faster!
0|Chevy Chase made a career of slipping on stairs as, help me out here, Gerry Ford, a (R)
0|Edgy
0|For someone that claims to be strong and tough and able to handle the machine she sure seems pretty thin skinned.
0|We literally just found out they were contingent upon each other so how could they possibly be two separate deals?
0|All that money big oil gives her is buying something more than 20 minute speeches...
0|They agree on many social issues but diverge sharply on how to fix the political and economical system.
1|Well since Obama won once, that means the system works perfectly.
0|Not as much as Trump.
0|Honestly, most Republicans don't even want to do that.
1|"Because when I think ""properly funding big government programs like NASA"", I think Donald Trump and the Republicans."
1|Just take a moment and remember that the writer is a liberal arts major and in most states not legally liable for his actions due to his IQ or lack there of.
1|Yeah if only they knew what was good for them...
0|Only if the textbook is of average size.
0|Plus the Senate won't confirm anyone for the SCOTUS who is too wacky.
1|Yeah because they've been so nice to him this whole election cycle.
0|You could say that about any ideology when it's not tempered by reason and pragmatism.
1|In  The_Donald, a place with all the right tools to handle it.
0|Blessed, as far as I can tell
1|Seems legit.
1|"Yes, people called out Hillary ""hot sauce"" Clinton for her CP time skit because they are racist and Hillary has never done anything wrong"
0|which means you multiply it by 3
0|I've never cringed during a Superbowl
0|"Clearly you don't know what those words mean and simply ""feel"" that they apply."
0|Or maybe they are trying to save lives and help erode a bit of the death grip the NRA has around America's throats... Being an act of terrorism doesn't change the fact that, like most domestic terrorism committed in this country, it was committed with a legally purchased assault rifle that 99% of citizens have no valid reason for needing to own.
1|Oh, well as long as the signs are confined to the narrowest of windows then no harm, no foul
1|Although I hear being a military contractor is a very lucrative business.
0|Yeah, but blaming certain candidates for a school shooting is *totally* a-okay...
0|Or offer insightful armchair opinions about others' intentions
0|Yea, you should have seen the place when we got here.
1|That *would* explain their new crunchy$hill taco.
0|Again, do you have any evidence or do you not?
1|Yup, us men are definitely getting shit on constantly
1|Nice guys finish last
0|Well, she is a real ball buster.
1|You're right they're wrong for seeing fault in corruption and trying to defend democracy
1|Yeah so much better than Lincoln, or FDR.
0|I must be a defective hillbot, since I voted for Bernie in our primary.
1|It's just Trump's convention bump
0|Nope, because they don't know why Bernie was popular so they can't fathom what's going on now.
1|It okay cause Google is a private company and they can show bias in their search results.
1|The checks of balances of a conservative Congress with a conservative Supreme Court ... Yes that will really protect against the insane decisions of the Conservative President...
0|I reallllly want to see his response to that gaffe, seeing as how he's made a career out of referencing 9/11.
1|So you'd prefer that special interests dictate the policy and make everyone else pay for it?
1|Yeah 2000 was a great one too!
1|And your job is currently being insourced via H1B visas so well played...
1|The name frightens me.
1|Come on dude, you can't hold Obama to the Trump Standard.
1|"TIL ""two wrongs now make a right."""
0|I'd imagine a robot would be better at using emails.
1|When did you hear an actual answer, source.
1|TIL the chair of the DNC resigned for no reason
0|She's also not supporting Clinton.
1|I'm so glad we're going to have leaders who can take criticism and deal with adversity.
1|Mid convention slump, classic, happens all the time, nothing to see here, move along
1|the posters paid to post on her behalf will make the claim, regardless of their actual feelings - gotta eat ya know
1|But... but... they hied actors to fill the seats
1|Are you overlooking that sweet transition music?
0|Lmao
1|If you guys would just vote for her, she'd show you!
1|I too think an expansion of corporate hegemony over asian markets, and tearing down barriers to quarterly profits are more important than my neighbors.
0|I first thought that would be a pretty good idea but the Mclaughlin group is very much about the personalities.
0|Her message sounds awfully a lot like Mitt Romney's
1|Sounds like something a shill would say.
1|Re-stating tired one liners disparaging governing really does a wonder to help the debate.
0|That's how we do.
0|I feel bad for the Sanders revolution then
0|You have no what we can do!
1|rekt
1|Yeah, because Clinton would never be in favor of a war in the Middle East, would she?
1|You're being ridiculous!
0|Free speech is literally Amendment 1 -- he probably got halfway through the preamble, but couldn't hold the rest in his tiny hands.
0|"Is Donald still touting ""The Art of the Deal"" now that the real author of that book has strongly un-endorsed Donald?"
0|The lack of empathy is far more important to me than his incorrect spelling.
1|Blue lives matter, but ref lives, fuck'em
0|Only one presidential candidate is in bed with Russian olicharchs and Putin, traitor.
0|Are you being ironic here, because saying Native Americans takes up less keystrokes than 'bow and arrow Indians'?
1|It's like Crowdstrike has a lot of experience with nation state actors, including this group or something.
0|yeah, right wing conspiracy nuts.
1|If Trump signed a pledge, then it must be true and he'll follow through if elected.
1|What a shill of you.
1|Yeah republicans have never said anything racist about Obama
1|Damn that California debate really would have given Sanders the edge he needs
0|Eventually
1|He's totally playing 16 D chess while the judges are playing tic tac toe.
0|Denial level: Republican
0|You can also use the exact quote from the video.
0|"Maybe what he's been doing *is* a metaphorical ""shooting a man in the street"" that he's been talking about and still *might* win the presidency?"
1|Naw Assange is all about transparency, he doesn't hand pick these to be political or anything.
1|No point if he drops out, we will basically become Mexico!
1|But liberals are the REAL racists!
0|The polls.
0|Said the idiot believing hearsay from a news anchors 3rd hand source with 0 verification or proof.
0|Are we living in a world where automation is dramatically reducing the need for work, or are our principles entirely uninformed by the world we live in?
0|Hating one woman with an opinion does not mean you hate all strong women with opinions.
1|Anyone that says anything bad about this article is a shill!
0|Well, yeah, if your normal person is a racist narcissist that you wouldn't entrust with managing a team of construction workers, let alone a country.
0|You know that hasnt gone into effect yet, right?
0|Trump is getting his comeuppance for the birther bullshit train
1|Caught you red handed, Commie scum!
1|Yeah, I certainly can't see trump doing anything else stupid over the next few weeks.
1|Dude, he's throwing
1|Yeah let's have the state enforce a Diebold monopoly, that'll turn out great for everyone
0|The establishment owns the media
1|To help her transition to prison?
0|Can be applied both ways my friend.
1|Cause that will prevent the clintons
0|The odds of someone becoming a Muslim while going to Punahou High School and smoking pot are like .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 percent.
1|that would be different.
1|But don't forget, both parties are the exact same.
1|Because no liberals have ever come out of Harvard?
1|Your anecdotal evidence sure has me convinced!
0|Just make Mexico pay the debt.
1|Yeah, but his last name is Obama and he's got a year-round tan, therefore he's clearly not a real American.
0|He wants government so small that it can fit inside of woman's vagina.
1|Hey, found the NAMBLA member, guys!
1|I say we grow some balls and tax more and get healthcare and education covered for all, it doesn't have to be super expensive (for schooling it could just mean college on an iPad with YouTube course videos) but we need to get everyone covered and pay more in taxes, as a person with no insurance I can only dream
0|Kind of like how Clinton used the Sandy Hook families?
1|Generalizations are always right.
1|That makes total sense since none of the recent terrorist attacks were perpetrated by European nationals, right?
1|im sure the secret service had no idea who he was
1|Totally sure Trump is quaking in his boots.
0|Aww the *real americans* you know the ones who vote republican.
0|There is no one that embodies Christianity's ideals less than Trump.
1|Oh right, I forgot - no community which includes *any* criminal is worth defending.
1|For the militias to be able to hunt under government orders, obviously.
1|No dude you don't understand, he's from Texas, he knows about guns...
0|"What elementary school did you go to that had orange idiots making death threats and getting awarded Purple Hearts ""the easy way"" ?"
1|Talk about an upset
1|Assange is clearly a traitor and a Russian spy.
1|Why does The Secret Service hate America?
0|It's pretty risky if you ask me, or if you ask our future president Donald J Trump.
0|So except for male white journalists working for Fox, are there any other Trump approved journalists?
1|No of course not, I mean when has Donald Trump ever made shit up I can't imagine someone not trusting every word he says.
1|Fucking entitled 80% just want handouts!
0|And her father was saved because of the 2nd Amendment and supporters of it.
1|forgot the
1|Time to open up a gun store!
1|But don't you know Trump reality is real reality?
1|Is this guy another Hillary plant?
1|Except vaccines; because it's totally sane to hate on vaccines
1|That's not a re-post, that's an original thought.
0|No problem, just discredit the source, checker and/or any news channel reporting the lie!
1|Well I did say modern.
0|Not if dea/pharmaceutical money has something to say she wont
0|You can't trade something that NOBODY wants.
0|When you refer to your political opponents as terrorists, just because they disagree with you, it devalues actual terrorism where people are actually killed.
1|Ya someone who donated his time and not money is terrible!
1|I'm sure she was emailing the nuclear launch codes around.
1|Apparently I dropped a
0|While I agree, I just want to inspire some critical thinking on the topic.
1|But he's right because Obama was alive during 9/11!
1|Sure those are the facts, but what do americans FEEL?
1|I asked everyone at my office and they are all voting trump, so the polls must be rigged.
0|"File under ""Things we should've been doing 10 months ago."""
0|And when their ideas fail, it's because they didn't go far enough.
1|Unless it's from Breitbart, it doesn't count.
1|He's going to start acting more presidential for the general election any day now!
0|Bernie was supported for his message but gained attention from msm because of cash he raised by the generation that's now being manipulated
0|So does Gary Johnson, and has the bonus feature of not being a raging orange asshat.
1|The skewed polls and rigged MSM, same as always
1|You people really don't get sarcasm....
1|But, but, he just said there's laws to prevent this?
1|Female named storms trigger me.
1|It'll be the most transparent administration ever!
0|I'm sure we all will...
1|you dropped this:
1|They should've studied STEM.
1|Hey, it worked for Bill Frist!
1|We need to get these weapons of war off the streets!
1|You're betraying your race and gender!
1|class warfare maybe.
0|How is taking money from someone for an unrelated cause supporting their authoritarian regime?
1|Just like there were no Islamist terrorist attacks before Obama!
0|"I like to think that those people imagine that in some excel spreadsheet somewhere, there is some column labeled ""waste"" that they can just delete to save money."
1|This doesn't seem like Poe's Law applies.
0|Especially the ones with a background in banking
0|you guys gonna send okeef in undercover to uncover voterscams?
1|Like they did with Bundy?
1|What a great off-topic discussion!
0|So that is a yes on your other account being banned from the subreddit most likely for the same hate you spew on this one.
1|I really hope you forgot
0|It'll still be defining if Rubio wins, as 2016 would mark the starting point of the robot takeover.
1|Cuz fuck the 8th Amendment, right?
1|answer is yes, unless you want Trump,
1|This record will soon be corrected.
1|It's all God's plan.
1|They're not illegal immigrants if they look hot.
1|Polls are lies and Clinton's cronies control the voting booths
1|But guys... I thought democrats and republicans were practically the same thing!
0|If only... LOL
1|Then we could have a giant cage fight, but with bullets!
1|He's only a millionaire, what a loser.
1|Yes, but... lots of reporters showed up!
1|It's good news as long as Obama and his drones had nothing to do with it
1|Well, Trump *said* he's going to win Washington, and did you see the size of the rally?
1|Maybe it should be in front of a burning car...
1|Looks like killing Scalia is the gift that keeps on giving for Hillary
1|yeah sanders was awful, so glad we didnt go with him
0|I don't think they do.
0|Oh shit I think I'm triggered right now
0|"Well, I meant for someone claiming to be the best fit to lead the USA, the ""other people did it"" excuse should not be valid."
1|President Romney can breath a sigh of relief.
1|But the Koch's told him so, so it must be true!
0|Sounds like you had one of those MCMinimum plans that had to be phased out because you were essentially paying for the privilege of going bankrupt should you suffer anything more serious than a cold.
0|Not unless you have a Tardis and can go back to stop his parents from Immigrating from Afghanistan by instituting a ban more than 3 decades ago.
1|that is just a vast right wing conspiracy that is totally true.
1|Who know this has been a weird election cycle
1|Oh sorry those are trumps supporters
1|That's a really funny joke
0|But that's the thing, there are so many people that aren't Republican or GOP that are having a hard time with what she did.
1|accusations equals lies equals blah blah blah I can't hear you.

0|but muh gun
0|Yeah fuck wealthy people amirite
0|Dont forget the vagina and last name along with a large population of elderly voters who get the majority of their information from the MSM.
1|Yeah, this doesn't scream deception and collusion at all.
1|I'm sure that this had nothing to do with religion.
1|Oh yeah, cause no Bernie supporters can relate to the message Trump has been speaking.
0|No I just downvote divisive and ignorant lies that add nothing to the conversation
1|But how do we know those aren't forged?
1|They clearly deserve it, or they wouldn't be down in the first place

1|Definitely worthy of that much spending
1|Running against Hillary is obviously sexist.
1|Just another outlier from an unreliable Republican-skewed pollster!
0|Funny how those blue states that are richest have absolute batshit crazy COLs to the point where you can hardly survive.
1|Only after Hillary releases her transcripts!
1|More non-pie-in-the-sky, real-world observations from Bernie.

1|Don't you know it is not the DNC or the Clintons responsibility to unify the party.
0|We could give up civil liberties or decide to take on the issue.
1|Yea that's what happened
1|Yep, the AP suppressed the will to vote And just in case
0|Because they have been told by the media that they shouldn't care about the email thing, not because the investigation isn't a real issue.
1|If only all the Black, Latino, women, gay, and Asian voters weren't so stupid and voted against their interest.
1|"""But we're making historrryyyy!"""
1|Trump doesn't have a soul, so he wasn't up for consideration

1|So how much did you sell your account for?
1|Pretty clear that this was voter suppression by the AP calling the race for Hillary last week!
1|Welp time for another crusade it looks like

1|Yeah but don't forget Trump is planning to take California and New York so that evens up the numbers.
1|Corporations are people too, my friend.
1|To be fair, he doesn't know of any personally so it seemed like a logical thing to say
0|Sure, and your comment totally isn't meant to spin the argument in any way either, oh no no no.
1|Correct this is how CIA appropriations are decided
1|Wow what a huge fucking surprise.
1|Right he just has to wait for Shillary to be arrested for murder or whatever and he will be in the White House.
1|Yeah, I'm sure all those vote would have gone to Hillary anyway
1|Trump will definitely win the woman vote this way!
1|Seems legit.
1|I thought they assimilated into the culture of mass shootings pretty well.
1|Yeah, since a high schooler with Republican parents is really going to be thinking for herself
1|Definitely he should live out his days isolated from his family.
1|He wasn't aware that he could get a fully automatic machine gun from a gun show without even showing ID!
0|But he is already banning Muslims
1|Then it's even more illegal and deadly.
1|Calling Bernie supporters Bernie Bro's and Obama supporters Obama boys is the highest form of praise in Elizabethan English.
1|in light of this hack, I am still convinced that HRC's Microsoft Exchange Email Server, stored in her bathroom closet remain secure.
1|Yeah, because the DNC will totally not nominate a candidate based on the information *they* kept, and that *they* didn't mean to go public while they tried to prop her up.
0|I doubt she's used cocaine but probably a lot of heavy prescription stuff.
0|So, same as now without the guns
1|They're just historical preferentialists.
1|No, you don't understand, he has a binder the proves it!
1|And you'd do it again, if it wasn't for those pesky voter ID laws.
1|At least he tells it like it is!
1|he has brown skin therefore he is a liberal.
0|I don't think any space is big enough to handle their machismo.
1|The real point is that trump is going to win the election and everyone is rigging it against him, of *course*
1|Biased poll
0|Finding out you're married to a Trump supporter -  1 cause of divorce in 2016.
1|Good thing those emails were illegally obtained, or we'd never have learned of this important story.
1|The shithawks are flying in low, trying to rig the election
1|Yeah, I live in Georgia, and some of us have considered that a wall along that Florida border might be a good way keep what ever it is that is causing that insanity from crossing into our state.

1|Rigged....
1|But that's the only data that counts right?
0|Not to mention that Trump's foundation spent a bunch of money buying a 6 foot painting of himself to put into one of his properties.
1|Great strategy, that should go over well
1|You forgot to mention her being short.
1|...and take all our guns, don't forget that.
1|No, dude, have you *seen* her?
1|I cant believe the Dems are rigging the election just because Trump is a rapist.
1|But Clinton is the founder of ISIS so its the same thing right?
1|..but that's not what he meant, he was being sarcastic.
1|Good strategy.
1|"Well it's reassuring to know that Bernie is making quid pro quo deals, insulting Catholics, holds public and private positions on issues, wants open borders, a hemispheric common market, and ranks his staff on their ""Diversity level."""
1|So what you're saying is that by the eighteenth debate he could hold it together for the whole thing!
1|Largest health care expansion in history, killed Bin Laden, brought the economy back from the brink, saved the auto industry, yeah it really showed
0|More like because Trump is the most unqualified person to ever run for president in the history of the United States while Hillary has a good grasp on politics in spite of her flaws and past mistakes.
1|And wikileaks is covering it up!
1|Never heard that one before.
1|But they could use it for a funding source
1|But he says he's doing it for the middle class and he wouldn't lie to us because he isn't a politicain
1|Yeah, all of that stuff definitely would have happened, even without the EPA...
1|With premiums like that lets just let it heal
1|But he didn't know anyone was listening!
1|So voting is optional at this point.
1|Same thing
0|Yes she really is lmao
1|I thought we didn't want Russians meddling in our elections?

0|And voting to repeal Obamacare was what?
0|Or Kevin Swanson, who wants to do the same thing here in the US and who said as much on a stage he shared with Ted Cruz back in December.

0|Gotta start somewhere.
0|Well I think my comment is a little more justified than another one of these submissions, seeing as how we've had a dozen of them up at any one time for months now

1|If a mere 40% of every hates you, you must be super charismatic.
1|Kind of like how CNN has a sterling reputation as a media organization as of late.
0|Edward Snowden is true hero and American patriot Thank You for your explanation as its such bullshit when people call him a treasonous traitor.

1|Because that's the only course of action.
0|In many cases, this really is true, though.
1|That's why he's hiding his tax returns.
1|This is kind of remarkable considering his campaign manager worked directly for Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin puppet in Ukraine, and was directly involved in Russian-Ukrainian relations.
1|It's those left wing institutions that are putting out misleading data and statistics for liberals to use as ammo.

0|They're not letting Bill near the Virgin Islands.
1|As soon as the average voter finds out that Trump is sexist, they'll recoil from him and vote Clinton.
1|Sure, that cigar is definitely not a Monica reference.
1|I'm sure they'll be clamoring to vote for Trump.
1|True, Sanders and his enormous foundation and business deals will be filled with all sorts of shady dealings.
1|I guess Trump is disqualified too since he dodged two debates
1|Because he like, totally wants to give us free money and we like want him more and stuff.

0|"This is more manipulative propaganda than news, more of the now constant messaging to Bernie Sanders supporters, ""just surrender to Hillary,"""
0|Bash him all you want- that should make Clinton look less cowardly.
0|Because using speech in that manner takes rights away from someone else
0|They are afraid to do their jobs in those areas though.
0|Lol, are you shocked that the Reddit mob first believed Gucifer when claiming to have hacked the server and then celebrated the leak as productive?
0|Where do you draw that conclusion?
0|Not for us democrats!
0|Planned parenthood is providing medical tissue from aborted fetuses to research institutions and charging them to cover the costs of doing so, yes.

1|Truly, the most conservative member of MSNBC must appease liberals whenever he can.
0|I am pretty sure nothing will happen and she'll be the next president.
0|Liberal SJW here, I want her carted off to jail
0|Plenty of other reasons besides health concerns.
0|So you would be cool with a scenario where Obama directs the AG to indict Trump on a racketeering charge related to Trump U.
0|That sounds terrifying, and makes me incredibly upset at the current state of mobile gaming and item crates.. All our kids are basically growing up gamblers.
0|Well, if the Democratic Party doesn't like democracy, I'm not sure why I should want them to win.
0|Sorry Nate Copper will always be in effect.
0|Hey man, I agree with you, I was just answering a math question.
1|TRUMP'S A RACIST
0|Nope.
0|10/10 read that as hand job
0|I don't think so, I believe what we're doing here is appreciating Trumps sensationalism and a little bit of roasting.
0|I just find it silly how you make these grandiose claims, completely ignore the examples I gave you that show how progressive she is, and don't provide examples yourself.
1|Fire,police, OPs Uncle is saint.
1|What about Tang?
0|The FBI and DOJ would disagree with you, but keep clinging to those lies you were sold, and keep buying that merch.
0|Corrupt to the core; I wish I were a Democrat instead of independent now so I could participate in the  DemExit tomorrow and tell them how I really feel.
1|GTFO with facts--she is a liar and no test can possibly capture the million integrity points other candidates will get when I choose who is the best
1|He has the best race of people doing it for him, apparently
0|So much for that ol' Reddit bump
0|It's far far more expensive than fracking too
0|Bernie is publicly supporting Hillary for the election, no?
0|Idiot.
0|Wow, I hope the security on John Carney is up for that scenario.
1|Nice to see the Randroids coming out in force.

1|Except for ignoring hundreds of warnings about 9/11 and completely botching the war in Iraq, the war on terror, the war in Afghanistan, failing to secure embassies resulting in 76 attacks, turning the US into a torturer ..... Ya, except for those things I guess we might.

0|"When things don't make sense, ""dorm room bong talk"" happens."

0|Umbridge maybe, but not Hermione.
0|Not if the plan is a GOP civil war with a full on convention meltdown.
0|its the guppy lips
1|Yeah, so let's elect her anyway since she can't be fired from a job she left.
0|The press talks for her, so why risk it?
0|When has that stopped conservatives before?
1|because that's the same thing
0|Kind of my point.
0|I'm not naive enough to believe random crap I read on the internet, nor baseless conjecture.
0|Let's vote for Hillary because she woman.
0|Well I always find it's entertaining when someone who attacks my intelligence can't spell even with spell check built in to everything
0|Is flag burning illegal?

0|"Hillary 'supporters' are so braindead they are still claiming that Hillary's illegal unsecured server was ""harder to hack than the Pentagon""."
0|I can't wait.... a flustered Trump is an entertaining Trump (not to mention, it usually results in him dropping a few points more in the polls)
0|Essentially, they don't want the same thing happening to them that happened to the GOP - a Tea Party-like takeover of the party.
0|Just kidding bro, just kidding bro!
1|Perhaps we should have a multi year multi million dollar investigation to find out.
0|Well, I also thought racism was dead or dying until November 2008, so I'm just preparing myself to be disappointed in my fellow Americans yet again, is all...
0|This is surprisingly clever
0|If Sanders giving her headaches, then Trump would cause a full blown stroke.
0|I think he goes around pretending to be rich, actually
1|But she didn't KNOWINGLY lie!
0|Maybe English 101 would benefit you as well.
0|If that's the case there should be plenty of substantive attacks you can launch on Clinton instead of focusing on her genitalia.
0|CONFIRMED: Washington Post is only being sold as hobo blankets!
0|How about they both get assassinated?
1|No, that's republicans silly!
1|Let's ban protesting and send the national guard to any illegal protests...
0|She really thinks it is our fault she doesn't tell the truth doesn't she?
0|By appointing a real person, not a rich, shapeshifting serpent?
0|Who would have thought that these two clowns would prove to unite bitter sports rivals?
0|Yeah, Weed kills you in under a second so i see that logic.
0|I have a hard time believing that the Democratic Party isn't making a huge mistake by nominating Clinton.
0|No need to hide things anymore.
0|I'll try more better next time.
1|Well if I know one thing that poor people are good at doing, it's saving receipts and itemizing their tax deductions!
0|Someone in the Trump campaign is channeling their inner Tyrion Lannister.

0|I might write in Bernie Sanders or Luke Skywalker for president, mainly to vote for down ticket positions.
0|fuck you.
1|Shame on you, handing over the whole election like that!
0|Yep.
0|I swear, I'm getting so tired of this CTR shit.
0|Kasich: I probably have more money than he does, and I have only $100 in my wallet right now.
0|So, he's just like Reagan?
0|He's totally triggered!
0|They also believe that Trump will still win, who cares of what the polls say!
1|Maybe she should be visiting soup kitchens instead of Bildeberg meetings.
0|*Ships manufacturing jobs to Mexico after getting elected* Uh, thanks Slick Willy.
1|Yes anyone not willing to read or believe right wing/GOP propaganda must be bad
0|More like a bootleg firework strapped to a office chair
1|Luckily, we have an unbiased organization like Breitbart to fact-check people.
0|"There never have been ""no debates""."
0|Imagine if the actually DNC nominated a candidate that could actually win without help from Trump.
0|There is a difference between poker and sports gambling.
0|You can't claim superdelegates, they vote at the convention.
0|Don't let your dreams be memes!
0|She's a conservative writer, ace.
1|Oh Obama, he has done so much to heal tensions in America
0|No, I think its Drumpf supporters that are the patsies.
1|I think you forgot this:
0|Hush, he's serving New Jersey best by being in Florida instead of doing his job
1|Well that's $1M in record correcting put to good use!
0|Only Trump can stump Trump.
1|That's working out great for Ron Paul's Liberty movement.
1|Yeah, because voters only make their decisions based on number of advertisements made.
0|Looking at the poll you will see its almost everyone
0|You apparently missed the RNC.
0|This is evidence that God is Q.
1|Yeah, because i see a lot of hassidic and amish folks shooting up night clubs to firward their religious agenda.
1|How reassuring.
0|Funny, I got a big warning from google that it was Malware.
1|Because Trump, with all of his ego, certainly wouldn't do that!
1|Hilary, of course!
1|Bet she's a CTR troll!
1|Yea, but Bernie!
1|No, this is about a Republican, not a Democrat!
1|Because, fuck the others, America first!
0|Except tons of black people wanted this crime bill because they saw what drugs and what not did to their communities.
0|When Hillary pulls the ball gag out of his mouth.
0|So, the perfect speaker for the RNC.
1|You forgot the
0|There shouldn't even be a minimum wage.
0|Trump won against Jeb who was arguably the monied candidate in the 2016 primary season.
1|well the fact you posted doesn't match the one in my mind.. so there
1|But any minute now.
1|Yeah, the same La Raza that counts Disney, Coca Cola, and Wells Fargo among its corporate sponsors, they're totally outside the mainstream
1|... it's completely acceptable to tell them to die
1|Yeah, because if there's been one consistent theme of Trump's campaign it's been being the better man
0|If that happens and Universal Health Care isn't implemented, bitches gonna get primaried.
0|I take it they are too liberal or something
1|Yes, this **only** applies to Republicans!
1|Oh well as long as it's in the guidelines then it's all A-OK!
0|I'm a pastor, but these are the people who drive me from the church.
1|Especially after what they did in the last 8 years in Libya and Afghanistan and how they armed the Syrian militants.
1|Right and I'm just sure the same would have happened if he was a white guy.
0|I guess what I'm getting at, is if you wanted to claim that you can't testify about something, even if it's concerning someone else's case, claiming it could implicate you in a crime, there really is no mechanism for you to be forced to prove that, so how could they ever pick and choose whether or not you'd be able to claim the 5th on something?
0|Do not hasten to ascribe to malice that which can be accomplished by stupidity
0|I think both choices are.
0|That would be the best timeline.
0|But he was already guaranteed to have wall to wall coverage this week due to the convention
1|Trump is literally Hitler, Stalin, Ghengis Khan, Darth Vader, and Voldemort all rolled into one person
0|You're getting ahead of yourself tiger
0|It still brought the questions of background checks onto the table, and no one did anything.
1|Yeah like Hillary
1|Nice reasoned, intellectual speech by Ben Carson, as per usual.
1|Maybe he can speak at his fathers convention... Oh wait, wrong family.
1|You mean Cuban Mexicans, right?
0|"""If it involves a steady paycheck I'll believe anything you say."""
1|Surely the rich will rediscover their innate altruism if only we got the meddling government out of the equation.

0|Lol, k.
1|"Yeah, if it's one thing the Times is known for it's ""typical rumor mill bullshit."""

0|Please point to any substantive actions taken by the DNC to tilt the scales in Hillary's favor.
0|"""You"" guys really like ignoring all of the stupid shit that comes out of his mouth huh?"
1|"Cuban's just bitter that his Apprentice clone, ""The Benefactor"", was shit."
0|I don't know if these comments are even useful for his base since he could have taken the opposite position and it also would have been applauded by his supporters.
0|lol Fuck if we don't witness a rigged general election, too.
1|But everyone in America is too dumb for those jobs and everyone in America is too smart for the jobs illegal immigrants take!
0|Yeah, needs to change.
0|With a cloth
0|"So he is using the schoolyard taunt ""I meant to do that"" rather than admit his mistakes."
1|Forgot the
1|I'm sure he will, he'll hand it over to Clinton which will make everyone happy!
1|Bill did the exact same thing in 1992 and 96 , this is why the dem party sucks so bad now , and Obama made sure they trolled America again in 2016 ... I'm trolling the dem party back by supporting Trump so he can have Sheriff Joe Arpaio arrest Hillary ...... half
1|I, for one, am shocked and appalled.
1|My money is still on the lizards!
1|There is no lengths he won't go to.
1|It's like the Russian nesting dolls, layers under layer, under layer, so on it goes.
0|I think he should give a better bid to all the employees of Correct The Record and send them to work drowning Reddit in comments about wealth disparity and the European rates for healthcare procedures and college tuition.
1|Unified party people
0|Anyone know what they're chanting?
1|yeah because it's only the convention causing this bump and nothing else
0|Nah it is
0|lol
0|Why not Johnson?
1|She is a woman.
1|No no no no, Trump got the most opposing delegate-nomination-votes ( Not American, I'm not sure what they were called) so his campaign is done for!
1|Ouch, my feelings.
0|lol
1|You sound like fun at parties.
0|It's always a bit distracting when you're caught red handed.
0|Let me thank... Let me th... Let me... Let... L... ...
1|Attempting to let fear rule peoples decisions sure sounds democratic.

0|Can confirm, I accomplish more on Monday than many of my coworkers do all week
1|I thought they was the same peoples
1|Zero chance.
0|How dare they be upset about massive corruption being swept under the rug.
1|You are right, catch your kid smoking and make him finish off a carton... that makes perfect sense.
0|If  politics is the major source of information I think I would count the reddit population as mostly misinformed as opposed to merely informed.
1|Wait I thought this was going to be a contested convention
0|You mean people who disagree with you?
1|But 20+ years of a conservative Supreme Court won't matter when the revolution happens.
1|Shock.
0|You should also not pay for health insurance premiums if you are healthy.
0|Thanks.
0|It looks like a snarky remark to the whole Russia hacking claim.
0|"Username is an anagram for ""A giver into NAMBLA"""
0|Is it really unfair when you can't even tell the difference between the two groups anymore?
0|Also, if nobody gets 270 electoral college votes, the House selects a president.
1|Yeah, it really stings.
1|Yeah, with the Republican platform and Mike Pence as VP you can see how far to the left they're turning.
0|I agree completely, and until we stop this tried and failed tactics, we are just making the world worse.
1|After reading this, I'm just so glad that DWS was able to land with a good job after this black mark on her record.
1|But I thought the RNC was gonna be filled with violence
0|feel good to know youre being manipulated?
1|That liberal search engine would just lie to me
0|"""his wishes"""
1|no no no... People who disagree with him *must* be paid to do so.

0|Because they are paid.
0|He's got his girl back at the hotel with the champagne on ice.

0|I dozed off before i was able to finish that sentence.
1|Yeah, it must be THEIR fault!
0|My sentiments exactly.
1|But the DNC is a private entity so they can do whatever they want
1|But they were the bad guys on The Simpsons Movie and Trump is gonna make things right, MAGA!

1|4D chess
0|That should be an easy 'no', not a 'probably not'.
0|How?
0|In economica there are also elements of nuance, debate, and unpredictability which doesn't fit into Trumps view that all issues are easy and have easy solutions.
1|Clearly the pollsters worked in tandem with the vote riggers to steal the election
1|But, crooked $hillary is bought by wall street.
1|Because the MSM ignores him and gave shillary the election
1|And no one has EVER squandered a double digit lead before...
1|So that raises her body count to 2 billion
0|She is the one actively undermining the party though.
0|Ya know regardless of how lopsided the polls are, even it it was certain that trump would loose the election in a landslide, it's still scary because he has come so close.
1|Another hilarious Trump joke
1|13 articles in this sub's first 2 pages...shouldn't we make a megathread to organize this properly?

1|Who would have thought that Judicial Watch was working for the Russians
0|Voters have the right to decide if this information, or the lack of it, is going to influence their vote.

1|Crooked Hillary Clinton of course

1|nah dude you're playing semantics
1|And she voted for the war in the middle East, because that was solely her decision, and Trump's opinion doesn't matter because he didn't have a vote and she knew so much more about what was happening than the public!

1|Yeah Dylan Roof sure seemed like a big time liberal...
1|But the accountants only took 1 minute to think of it!
1|Yeah we should absolutely make someone leave the country for thinking differently and having the nerve to actually use that silly old free speech thing.
1|I think that would be any decent person's takeaway from the article.

0|that's our little front runner
0|FTFY **Translation:** Hillary Clinton will ~~soon stop lying to liberals,~~ continue lying to liberals but will also and start lying to moderates and conservatives.

1|Yeah, he should just pretend they don't exist to stick with his moral convictions!

1|That's sexist
1|But those are *efficient*, *job creating* death panels!
1|HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I LOVE FUNNY JOKES
1|But Trump pretended to be somebody else!
1|You're being dramatic, they barely trained and armed Osama!
1|Probably because Trump would be such a dictator that he would enact FDR's court packing strategy and appoint approximately 300 kkk members to the supreme court.
1|Yeah that's why Obama got elected!
1|Yeah, but where else would he go to complain?
0|Pretty dangerous rhetoric for a republican, considering his endorsement would go a LOOOOOONG way in helping Trump secure Ohio.

1|Just more of the MSM's desperate biased smear campaign to manufacture controversy by quoting Republican after Republican ripping on their own nominee, and their own party for choosing him.
0|"That is fair point but that is still a dangerous policy to put in place and what defines ""significant improvement""?"
1|He's so brave!
0|That's because HuPo is a gigantic liberal media outlet and that would hurt their narrative, of course they're not going to mention it.
0|"The standard defense to ""she agrees with Sanders on 95% of issues"" is either a) she's a flip flopper who will just take any position that wins the election for her (which is somewhat silly since I would think you want your political representative to actually represent the population) or b) She just lies and is lying now and was lying during the entire lifetime she spent championing, and working her ass off to implement, progressive policies"
0|So to clarify, your argument is that although they're in middle school, they'll still be able to post their support for Trump because they aren't paying attention in class.

0|Uh I need an adult!
1|Wikileaks (largely staffed by non-US citizens) totally isn't taking sides in the election and trying to influence it.
1|Yeah... Mhm you totally sounds like a Bernie-supporting democrat.
0|Rigged elections cannot account for a discrepancy of a few million votes.
0|I'm fully aware, I was hiding off other comments to this and wanted to make sure.
1|Yes, affixed securely to a glass ceiling.

1|You sure you don't want to see her in a disrobed state?
1|She'll clean them with a sponge
0|It just shows that his most important statements are wrong.
0|Time and time again, this point needs stated, but that would hand Trump the election.
0|Which is why I wrote jigglypuff
0|Be careful or you'll get banned for making a reasonable assumption.
1|it's sarcasm.
0|Now, now, are you saying Donald would lie to the American people?
1|its her turn
0|"Way to keep things ""civil."""
1|Because it means your weak, and unloving.
0|HA Goodman is an embarrassment to Sanders supporters
1|I'm sure nypost has a 'reliable' source to back up its claim right?
1|But Trump's wall is bad.
1|But can't she sell out and support and Trump?
0|Banned!
1|Here you go, you forgot this:
1|Yeah they totally didn't mention that Trump is evil and will destroy America if elected
0|Like with a cloth?
0|Are people ignorant or complacent?
1|Who knew Pelosi was such misogynistic bigot, how dare she stand against women!
1|But how is Trump's 'convention bump' getting into Hillary's Democratic convention?
0|It's actually a play but yeah the movie is cool too
0|Facist rallies usually do have a lot of energy.
1|"No but I have watched the vote be ""brought under control each election the manipulation is more refined and the news people back it all up with special stories explaining how people are just too damn dumb to be allowed to vote and don't even vote once they have been stripped from the registration lists."
1|So damn right on top of things they spent years warning the people and the nations about the impending economic disaster and had downgraded many of those large institutions that failed.
0|Her policies and what she has supported over her years served.
0|Bill should try his hand at writing romance novels.
1|Idk man a few more upvotes and I think we've got this
1|Right, because this country will go into total destruction if Trump is elected.
1|I'd trust her more, personally
0|It was in a recent PPP poll
0|As did Reagan.
1|kgb spy
1|Pull up your pants your big baby and fall in line bernie bro, it's your fault that the democratic party doesn't have enough votes to beat trump!
0|Thanks fam, fixed
0|Well, I believe those servers are offline as well, but I agree with your statement as far as deleting info
0|Certainly since Reagan.
0|So if you don't believe her when she does make changes to win over other voters, like opposing TPP, what you really mean is there's nothing she can say or do to change your mind, despite actively changing her campaign to unify the party?
1|Well certainly do everything you can do to get Trump elected then...
1|Bus she's such a champion for women and little girls everywhere!
0|So many metaphors, so little substance...
1|Ah yes, Clinton did wonders at the State Department.
1|But they are unified.
1|you forgot your
1|Well, thank God Michele *Crazy Eyes* Bachmann will steer him on a course to victory!
1|Of course, what rational person would think that a government that has probably killed journalists that criticize it might be lying.
1|Oh yeah, his heavily censored, boring, low energy AMA *really* demonstrated that Grandpa Trump is a master at social media.
1|Just stop standing up for what you believe in!
0|It's not funny when you say real things.
1|Worked great for the tea party!
1|No no, they're obviously stupid children that won't just fall in line.
1|Yes you're right the Pro-TPP, Pro Coal Queen of Fracking is such a champion of progressiveness.
1|Yes because all republicans are racist bigots
0|And martial artist.
1|Don't forget gays/trans that want to fondle our kids in bathrooms!
1|But it was her turn and also 9/11
1|"Right, they just gun down planned parenthood and call it a ""righteous crusade"", totally different?"
1|Surprise!
0|You are kinda fear mongering right now.
1|Yeah, cuz Hillary definitely doesn't sell influence, or cheat in elections, or try to stifle people who would speak against her.
1|Only a half a standard deviation... or so.
1|Yeah, Hillary is the pinnacle of class.
0|With how bombastically shitty Trump is with his attitude and Clinton is with her record, I feel like a lot of people might miss how shitty Kaine and Pence are in the way traditional politicians are.
1|I think you forgot the
1|Guys, I think I got one
0|She made him?
1|No way this happened on Reddit....
0|The basis of my argument has literally nothing to do with whether or not you support Hillary.
1|I guess I dropped the
1|well then you are the uncle tom of muslims!
0|Yeah, since that's how she won the primary
1|Oh that money doesn't bias her in any way though.
1|Oh that must be what Khan was referring to.
1|Must be why so many millionaire mega donors are supporting him and not Hillary
0|And one of those wars destabilized a region and led to the rise of one of the most dangerous terrorist organizations of all time.
0|Fuck hillary clinton
0|I predict several acts of violence at polling places.
0|The Trumplerinas will start to double up on the meth to be able to take all this shit coming from The Orange turd's mouth.
0|I just want to point out that just because someone is handicapped does not mean they don't understand consequences.
1|because Comey is a liar
1|You mean like with Obama's birth certificate?
1|I didn't say it was funny
1|She spent 8 years to build the connections and set it up so she would not lose again of course!
0|If only we had a huge leak to show the DNC was laundering money for the Clinton campaign to bypass donation regulations... i guess you missed that bit of knowledge
0|So why is Bernie losing 2:1 in open primaries if he has all the support of the Independents ?
0|They said the best words; as well as quite a few of the not so best words.
0|I'm falling in love with everyone posting these comments.
0|How so?
1|Wow I can't believe George W Bush is a CTR shill
0|Can people who don't understand this poll stop referring to it?
0|Eloquently put.
1|Get your nuance out of here, shill
0|I wish it was cheap :-( One of the reasons we need to do something about extreme inequality is that regular folks just cannot afford the price tag of being represented.
1|They obviously meant that Obama was fighting against America with his Muslim brothers and killed Khan for being a traitor!
0|It's all a secret lizard people takeover smokescreen... that somehow involves Islam
0|Bernie Sanders will tell you that's definitely not true.
1|True, but she's hot and European, normal Visa laws don't apply.
1|Just like Bill, that will destroy the economy and drive up deficits, just like Bill
1|We are legion
1|Please stop with the attacks, Melania is white, rules don't apply to white immigrants.
0|He didn't actually say this right?
0|It's not that she doesn't like Weiner...She has just had enough of Weiner's shit.
0|Well go on, where are they?
1|The e-mails that say that Bernie is a bad guy!
1|Yea, they should become white if they don't want to get killed!
1|Don't forget Sarah Palin and Carly Fiorina!
1|Incredible subtle pivot there!
1|We, the people, demand unskewed numbers!
0|Pretty sure she has a rally in Reno tonight?
1|Upload my mixtape
1|It's the messenger, not the message, that's important.
1|I guess that's why all the candidates are slipping Purple Hearts into their coat pockets...the sense of entitlement that is natural and normal during a political campaign.
0|He also has a fairly close relationship with David Pecker the CEO of the company that owns The National Enquirer-- so it is unlikely they would ever run anything on him during the campaign period.
1|first that Jew hater Obama attacked her, now a Jew is doing it!
0|....and I'm the Queen of England.
0|Didn't she also hint at Barack Obama being assassinated back in 2008?
0|I'm a conservative who wouldn't vote for Trump in a million years and I believe this theory
1|I'm sure that's exactly what he meant.
0|Then by all means, spoon-feed me some examples of Trump's kindness/generosity.
1|Yeah, in the brutally close democratic primary that essentially chose between the two *actual* presidential candidates, thousands of Democrats threw away their vote because they were scared Cruz would win.
1|I mean it's not the real president if the election is rigged
1|You forgot the
0|Dude he's right.
1|It did a great job monitoring Flint for years!
0|Didn't they also try to prove guns are rarely used in self defense by only counting the self defense scenarios were a criminal was killed by his victim while ignoring the once were the gun caused the criminal run away or where they were held at gunpoint until the police arrived?
1|"Nope, no ""social media outreach"" going on here."
1|Disregard, best president of all time
1|"Liberal media bias changed the word ""literally"" to mean literal"
1|Thanks Obama!
1|Damn right - a one-sentence hate-tweet is a much better method of informing voters...
1|Always use
1|Oh come on, anyone familiar with Heller knows it's a light and easy opinion to read.
1|Yeah, like all the things Obama said and we really made sure he stayed to his word!
0|can you please tell me what would be wrong with this if she did this on her own time with her own money?
1|Make America Great Again
1|Insightful.
1|You forgot this
1|I think this article states pretty clearly that Climton is the most qualified candidate for president in the history of the universe and all parallel universes!
1|The rebuplican run laws, obviously.
0|Trump's tax plan seems to be based on the idea that the rich in America don't have enough money.
1|He's costing her the white supremacist vote!
1|Great job voting for Carter!
1|Unfortunately thats probably not that far off from the truth... But would that mean Fox news will be liberalised?
1|Except when he's being sarcastic of course!
1|I demand a criminal investigation into Clinton's blatant bias against Trump.
0|Romney did eventually release just the two most current years (far less than virtually every candidate) of his tax returns - but not until *later than now* in his own election cycle.
1|Benghazi?
1|Well duh because Obama hadn't invented terrorism yet!
1|Oh, I meant Frederick William IV of Prussia, since he ruled the country in a fair, yet fairly conservative way, and even created the first Prussian parliament...
0|Its funny - Since the 16 articles against Bernie, I have not faith in WAPO and have not read a single article.. Such an important paper shouldnt be bias and more important should not screw the facts
0|Some people also care about abortion rights.
1|Let's kill all the whistleblowers, that'll definitely make us safer and more free.
1|He of course doesn't think so, he is too humble... but very smart people *are* saying it.
1|Yes, *but you didn't hear about it*
1|We should actually make homophobia and anti-semitism a requirement for immigration.
0|When the alternative is smoke signals, I'll take Comcast all day.
0|That's why I want to keep seeing Breitbart here, I like seeing rebuttals and commentary on everything.
1|That's just what CTR *would* say....
0|Don't act like you're surprised.
0|Pretty sure that callmemrpib was referencing FDR being in a wheelchair for the tail end of his presidency.
0|From a macro perspective your suggestion seems the most logical, its fundamentally flawed in my opinion by being overly cynical and discouraging following one's own conscience however but thats just my viewpoint.
1|Because praying and kind words will stop genocide.
1|Yeah, I'm sure the FBI never asked Clinton about her intentions or did any investigation on it at all after a year of investigating.
1|I think trump forgot to add the

1|Says Who?
0|Also it's as if they've never heard of a ladder before either.
1|Yeah I know, it does... I just forgot my
1|You mean laundered their wall street bribes through the criminal Clinton Foundation slush fund?
1|It's not his fault that common sense has a liberal bias!
1|Finally, I couldn't sleep at night knowing that the powerful force that is the Islamic State Navy could invade us un-walled!
0|As Americans we don't assume everyone thinks jews are evil and must be destroyed anytime somebody mentions that they are jews.
1|Gee Whiz I can't imagine Shussh kids Uncle Rush has a big secret he want's to tell us.
1|It's nice to know the mind of god.
0|Following your line of thinking, how would democracy be worth anything at that point?
1|They aren't hate symbols, they are our culture
0|When the republicans send their people, they aren't sending their best.
1|You missed vampire and possessed.
1|Obviously, you were an old account that was sold to CTR.
1|I mean he is saying what we're all thinking right?
1|Quit being so PC.
1|Well, she is kinda sorta brown so she must be a dirty Muslim sleeper cell!
1|Yes, very fair and none of the candidates were tossed idiotic questions about their rivals.

0|Hmm, been a Redditor for 8 years... Probably one of those Hillary CtR Shills!
1|Just tax the rich and provide free hookers for the middle class!
0|Seriously?
0|no its actually not.
1|He's just a really generous guy
0|Then the exit polls are rigged!
0|The fact that you suggest this underlines how little you actually understand about the situation.
1|Plot twist: Bernie's campaign keeps 99% of the money Lucy raised
0|Probably just wants to cover for the general public's (and media's) attention span.
0|admitted it after trump secured the nomination WOW so noble
1|My god, what a racist.
0|Shhh... It's impolite to mention their war crimes when the elites are having a party.
1|you forgot the
0|You were drunk while voting lol
0|That is to say, an uncompromising ideological extremist.
0|Didn't they already try that with Obama?
0|Even the symbolism matters.
1|Yeah, but those are poor people.
1|All of 3.6% IIRC, and the stock market totally collapsed.
1|Sounds like someone's correcting the record.
1|IT TELLS ME THAT WE SHOULD BE NICER TO THE TERRORISTS!
0|Yes.
0|Pretty much; anything that paints HRC in a negative context makes the whole subreddit Anti-Hillary
1|Those 7 delegates he got in West Virginia really cut into Hillary's lead.
1|Sanders, just another paid Hillary shill.
0|did you get downvoted?
1|Trump is going to release his tax returns at the same time he releases the stuff he found out about Obama in Hawaii.
1|She can't be part of the establishment, because she's a woman.
1|Yeah, but Mexico will pay, remember?
1|I'm sure the more expensive employer-funded healthcare option will better help reduce debt.
1|impartial...
1|Because no one has ever organized criminal activities from prison
0|How is it twisting his words to point out that it would be hard to vote for her if she isn't the nominee?
0|thats a strong assumption
0|Or, you know, we get Reagan, Bush, Trump....
1|No these are high info and well educated voters!
1|Well the creepy old white male Republicans are at risk of accidentally being propositioned by a transgender, instead of a child.
1|what a surprise.
1|Because Kentucky is such a crucial battleground state
1|So... He'll ask Clinton to be his VP, then?
1|Sounds like democracy died at your convention too!
0|"It will lead to lawsuits trying to get a new candidate on the ballot in a lot of states, but ultimately the court would probably order that a new candidate be put on the ballot and the DNC to pay for whatever ""damages"" (extra costs, printing, whatever) result from the late substitution"
1|Sound like a socialist
1|All the more reason why she should be elected to the most powerful position in the world.
1|I see you read the article.
0|Hence my opposition to Social Security.
1|You dropped this
1|Biggest mistake America ever made was getting rid of those literacy tests and giving darkies the right to vote
1|Yes, and racial tolerance is the new genocide
0|How will she sleep at night?

1|That's different
1|She loses by getting less votes than her opponent.
0|A thousand up or down is a bit more than vote fuzzing, to be fair.
1|Just a right wing conspiracy
1|Everyone else did it, she was given clearance
1|Well since she says so... that makes it okay right guys?
1|SO nice to see that the bernie supporters are being so peaceful and that its everyone else being volatile .
1|But she didn't coordinate with the 'Ready for Hillary' initiative.
1|But she's the most qualified!
1|Yeah all the tariffs he calls for are super free market.
1|"a ""pragmatic"" one"
0|No, it's called being successful
0|But there are more people in the urban areas which means they need more polling places or days to be able to get everyone through.
1|I'm crying *single tear*
1|"Just a tiny handful of loud ""Bernie Bros"" on the internet."
1|get out of here with your logical thinking
0|No but I am.
1|That's because you're probably a man and don't understand what the world is actually like!
1|"It's okay, they're all ""low information voters"" so this is really everyone just helping them make the right choice!"

1|No, I actually put effort into that.
1|Nah, man, we need to start lopping off hands as punishment for theft, just like the good ol' days!
0|Doesn't make it right, just means most are crooks
0|But Obama wasn't at the center of an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Inquiries.
0|The Trump subreddit will just quote the first half.
0|IIRC, since the advent of superdelegates its been roughly 50/50.
1|I just really feel like she had a better chance of winning
1|Don't blame the party, it's the *people* who are out of touch
1|No, I'm sure it's a Daily Mail conspiracy to get the front page of Reddit
1|Or cronyism and nepotism, but I'm sure Trump wouldn't stoop that low.
0|hahaha these clinton surrogates are delusional if they think sanders or any substantial portion of his supporters will 'get on board' with hillary.
1|He was playing the long game, it was a 25 year long con job.
1|And we all know she never lies
1|Completely what could go wrong
0|Do as I say, Not as I do.

1|associated press, another in a long line of republican smear merchants
0|some of them are probably hired as a favor to somebody.
1|I thought the establishment decided who was president, how could she lose re-election
1|I get all of my news from unbiased Buzzfeed!
1|But those tax breaks for corporations will trickle down
0|Well, we have the Bill...
0|They literally have a division out to get him.
0|Oh man, can't wait for Trumps next zinger on twitter!
0|I'm still thinking we could get 5% green party
1|You dropped this
0|You're 100% right.
0|At least your user name is accurate...
1|Yeah, she's been just lovely during this entire primary process.
1|But Christians are just as bad, sometimes they protest
0|None of them has been Hillary Clinton atop the Clinton machine at it's highest strength.
1|Yes, hyperbole is logic.
1|By not acknowledging what we all know, that this is a clash of civilizations and therefore must be solved with some good old ethic cleansing.
1|But shooting one is scary and loud!
1|Yes because pushing sexuality protections in ENDA under the Bush Presidency was a winner
1|Yeah, thanks to Affirmative Action^TM
1|You mean to tell me it *ISN'T*
0|Are we still doing that?
0|I'm assuming you mean debt to equity ratio because asset makes very little sense when talking about countries...
1|Just call them illegals then!
1|Your argument is so black and white, it must be bulletproof!
1|well this time is for real
1|Well they tried to abolish the EPA, certainly that should have helped things
1|She has a black friend who told her it's fine.
1|They might be trying to draw the Hindu symbol rather than the Nazi one.
1|See, i just dont understand the basis for those accusations.
1|I'm sure these groups will cool down after election day
1|Yeah scree those vagrants, let them die like dogs in the street.
1|It's not like 536 votes makes a difference in a national election
1|All illegals are brown everyone knows this
1|Those natives sure need to learn not to trespass in land that isn't theirs.
1|I can't bring my homemade bombs to the National Guard, so I created my own militia.

0|If Hillary didn't like it so much why didn't she change the law on groping?
0|u mad about the internet now too
1|Because that's what is was.
1|Right, like Infowars reports actuial, valid information!

1|We never had a terrorist attack before Obama, remember?
1|Good thing it's not a 4 way race
0|Thank you for this.
1|Which automatically means it's the wrong position to take, amirite?

0|Ah the old stick your head in the sand and hope it goes away strategy.
0|I find people under current FBI investigation a second time and who lied repeatedly about it, untrustworthy.
0|Given her health issues I would think more about Tim Kaine SCOTUS picks.
1|Schultz was biased against one of the candidates, let's replace her with someone impartial and honest
0|Perhaps I should say: not let this article about Hillary sucking allow us to forget about Trump's terrible qualities.
1|Yes, golly, none of that Russian stuff could be related to Trump, he's far too much of a patriot to do anything illegal involving Russia!
1|Come on dude, a militant Muslim runs the white house.
1|You forgot the
0|Second your mention of Grant, although he wasn't really all that corrupt until after his election.
0|You do realize there is a reason religion is included with things like race, sex, and national origin in our list of protected classes right?

0|The DNC and Clinton just happen to have better policies for Americans.
0|Who does Trump represent beyond himself?
0|Well not only is this claim dubious, do you really think Trump (or any major politician) don't pay thousands for clothing?

0|"Yea, it sure ""deescalated"" nicely."
0|Yup, Donald gets them ratings but they still trust that HRC would secure the nomination.
1|Yeah privatization always leads to greater transparency.
1|Maybe that's why the establishment loves him so much.
1|Lots of excellent options at this stage
0|LOL; if you really thing your centrist politicans like Bernie are comparable to Lenin... I suggest you come back to the days of the USSR and live in Poland.... MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.
1|Yeah, but if it weren't a caucus he'd have like 20 million extra votes now and clearly ahead of Clinton, so caucus actually hurts him you know.
1|Was there a primary today?
1|Wasn't he the one who bitched about not getting enough time during the debate?
0|Sorry if I did :p thanks for being kind about it as well
1|Oh but he's just playing nice because he has to, because it's politics!
0|This guy again?
1|And they showed such good judgement back then too.

1|No one is even considering removing their right to bare arms, just their right to buy guns.
1|Obviously some kind of seditious, right wing propaganda.

1|Color me surprised.
1|Everyone knows Hitler went out of his way to never offend anybody
1|But they voted identically 93% of the time!

0|If you got fired from your last job, I don't want you as a president.
0|I would take either third party over the two turds we have in the Democratic or Republican parties currently.
0|Ha!
1|Plus, think about all the good will that Obama generated amongst the GOP for not prosecuting Bush Admin torturers.

0|And yet, he lost by almost 4 million votes.
0|Empty bet, they are going to take it all anyhow:p
0|All the way down to the brown note.

0|9/11 happened under Bush tho.

0|My apologies.I was referring to Johnson (I think is his name)
0|Dan Savage recently tweeted that Bernie miffed an LGBT icon, does that mean Dan Savage is a Clinton surrogate too?
0|I think the Trump negative narratives will fall apart or weaken quite a bit if there'a debate.
1|Yeah, I'm sure the FBI could come up with all kinds of legitimate reasons to not indict someone when we have mountains of evidence that half a dozen or more serious laws have been broken!

0|Has Hillary released her Goldman transcripts yet?
0|The people who own the property don't want the liability of something happening because of guns in the building, which is their prerogative, regardless of whether or not a republican believes guns are good or not.
0|because nobody has bothered to attack him....the same reason why kasich in GE polls beat hillary by 20 points...i guess Trump should drop out and the GOP should give the nomination to kasich, then.

0|As I said, psychopath.
0|The difference is those other guys ran out of money.
0|This money would be used for pedestrian access, protected bike infrastructure, and better public transit, not just extra lanes on highways that would inevitably induce more congestion... Right?
0|He's saying he also saw 3 cars on a different highway, hoping you'll forget that he mentioned the 4 cars at all.

1|Would you rather they talk about their looks
1|Surely running a business teaches you all you need to know about economics and fiscal policy!
1|Anything not specifically mentioned by Jesus is left up to the states to decide
0|See US relations with Singapore and the Gulf States.
1|It's so hip and cool to support Obama, Hillary or Bernie...they want gun control, I guess I do too.
0|ok, that doesn't change my point though.
1|He makes up for that by getting rid of the estate tax which is a huge boon for the poor and middle class.

0|It's positively purple!
1|Oh the poor man.
1|I'm sure it's just CTR paying off the lot of them.
1|But but think of the millions of people President trump will kill
1|Yeah because when Hillary is already president and is assigning judges the 2nd amendment voters are definitely gonna stop her
0|But Trumpettes love him because he says it like it is, but all of a sudden now his words are open to interpretation by the very people.

0|He loves attention as much a Trump its truly fascinating.
1|Hey man he is just saying what everyone else is thinking...
1|Yeah but it took them 8 long hours to denounce, they didn't go with their guts, thought through potential consequences, held a discussion about the right thing to do, took the time to write a politically correct statement that wouldn't be offensive, and they are therefore bad leaders and you shouldn't vote for them.
1|stop being partisan
0|Bernie, you are my hero.
0|Even people with full time jobs often have outside interests, hobbies, charities, etc.

1|Polls don't mean anything
0|Yeah, himself
1|Fire bomb his campaign and get the Democrats to pay for the repairs.

1|God's plan can't explain it
0|Er, this isn't the US politics sub, this is the politics sub :)
1|Right, because he would never use such language

1|Voter fraud confirmed
1|Gosh why didn't they come out sooner
0|It's better if you read it with a Russian accent.
0|For anyone actually wondering--rather than spinning--the answer is it lends strong support to the suspicion the videos are simply a new entry in the man's portfolio of dishonestly-edited videos that suggest the interviewees are saying something completely different than they are.

1|Democrats = Hillary

1|Why would that matter when he is funding his own campaign?
1|You're right, we should stop negotiating.
0|"What are the ""plenty of problems"" they have to deal with?"
1|It's different because trump is a lying racist with ties to the Soviet Union
1|I guess I should have added

0|Oh this is good
0|So basically it's just for tax purposes and to make him look like a philanthropist instead of a selfish, greedy a-hole.
1|Have you tried working more?
0|lol you should see the facts the people of  the_donald ignore
1|they're literally ripping babies out of the vagina!

0|I'd be curious if you thought he was a partisan hack when he announced there would be no indictment a few months back.
1|Hmmm none of those had a racist Pepe cartoon, hot babes, or a trump train circle jerk so I don't think I can trust them
1|And that makes him smart!
0|Trump voters don't disappear after the election...
0|Trump: Wait...I'll tell you the truth about Melania...I'll release my tax returns...anything but the fact I tried to get Hillary assassinated.
0|I'm starting to think that the rules of 3D chess involve punching yourself in the dick over and over and over again.

1|Well, that should allow the FBI to wrap up the security review
0|Holy shit.
0|I'm just betting you were all for them when Trump was leading in the primaries, right?
0|And my point is that certain people are ignorant enough to believe the certain bullshit.
0|Of course, when we get to the debates and he basically pulls out evidence she failed the drug test (emails, lies, national security risks), the actual run time may not matter... In a contest of 'which candidate has bigger flaws', it is best not to be throwing stones...
0|Do you understand the difference between a vote and an endorsement?
0|How does one break a crime
0|And Bush was a compassionate conservative.
0|Yes, by elaborating on literally any of those.
0|Leaked emails make Hillary Clinton an illegitimate candidate and there's absolutely nothing that the DNC or even Bernie Sanders can do to change this.
0|Its like we're raising a whole generation to eat and breathe Clinton hysteria.
0|Never mind all those times it definitely was, let's focus on outliers instead.
0|I would be shocked if 59% of Americans are even paying attention to the election.
0|Do you have a source for any of that?
0|No, she did not.
0|Except for being an honest person.
0|You trust her?
0|Yep.

0|Why does she advocate strategic regime change as was her rationale behind voting for the Iraq war, and recommending the course of action in Libya?
0|Federal Bureau of Inequity Justice for some, but not for others.
1|Kinda makes me wonder why the FBI went ahead and had the interview today if they already knew the outcome.

0|Mittens has himself to blame for that loss.
0|There were maybe 2 or 3 BAD lobbyists, but others were lobbying for good organizations like Planned Parenthood.
1|Damn it, if Hillary doesn't go to prison it might mean that Bernie has no chance of being president, I am not saying he is completely out of the running though.
1|No, it's still a vote for Trump, because if you don't vote for the queen, you're voting for Trump
0|No, but good try at a strawman.
0|zero evidence of what ill be glad to provide
1|"but then you'll be publicly shamed for not posting a selfie on facebook with an ""i voted"" button"

0|Well someone should tell them that many of his stances are pretty liberal
1|Dont be ridiculous with your real life experience, the liberals know that Trump and America first is a toxic idea.

1|None of the money influenced her, though.
0|Yea you provided zero context for that first comment... Not sure how you expected anyone to know what you were talking about.
1|This is nothing compared to the most negatively run campaign by the Sanders camp!
1|Now, what on Earth would give you that idea?
0|"So ""was elected based on identity politics"" and ""was qualified"" is a proper dichotomy?"
1|"the worst that could happen is Hillary decides to play ""Global Thermonuclear War"" with Kim Jong Un, and we successfully reverse global warming."

1|He talked about her stances on several issues, such an asshole that Slanders dude
1|You just don't understand man, after like 4 months of rallies, town halls, debates, wall-to-wall press coverage in both MSM and alternative outlets, the reason why these people aren't registered is because they just haven't heard Bernie's message yet!
1|My calculations say 33.8%
1|Yeah, who cares about Donald's constant fraud.
1|that's because obviously ALL white men have opportunities thrown at them like rice at a bride/groom sendoff, so basically any white person who isnt successful is just a lazy turd that chose not to eat off the silver platter that is his life.

1|Nothing to see here then, let's move on.
1|Yea millions of voters were to totallyl disenfranchised
1|Agreed... especially after the party treated him so well..
1|Yeah but they only removed posts that were violating reddits rules
1|"Yes I'm sure one of her campaign platforms is ""no jobs for the middle class"" that sure does make a lot of sense doesn't it?"
1|Don't worry I rely on fox and CNN too
1|But it's a religion of peace, you bigot!
1|who cares about issues now, Hillary is evil and anything but her
1|But those are in low information south and hence don't count
1|But Kenya isn't a race
1|So Trump admits he's foreign born?
1|Oh yeah, if we had just bankrolled more money into the system then they wouldn't have hacked!
1|But.. But if you put major party in front of it, it makes it true!
1|Yea we let them vote so there wasn't any racism!
1|But he said none of those are reasons to oppose gay marriage so your argument is invalid
1|Obviously it was Republican rhetoric.
1|But just one or two years of testing rich people...would make for some entertaining news!
1|Hahahaha, wow I'm sure Donald Trump will be outraged by this
1|Well it's obviously the fault of those nearby states that don't have strong gun control.
0|I just threw up in my mouth a little.
0|You know they don't just go around re-hearing previous decisions in order to overturn them right?
1|but our 'security' is growing.
1|Aside from Woody Harrelson.
1|Results of the FBI primary coming in any day now
0|Not to mention the flip flopping...
1|Do you really want trump as president?
1|Let's go back to a time before Clinton when Democrats kept losing the Presidency and letting conservative Republicans rule.
1|Just like my abuela!
1|Yes, because Reddit is clearly a more accurate indicator than the votes themselves.
1|Yea, if it wasn't illegal, it must have been the right thing to do, in keeping with the principles of good-faith, transparency, and accountability...
0|This post is much worse
1|But it will be good for American BusinessTM!
1|Don't forget she was named after the first man to climb Mt Everest: Sir Edmund Hillary.
0|I'd definitely be all for that.
1|Oh yeah, we never got outraged when he said Mexicans are rapists.
1|yep, hillary is the real victim here.
1|Jeff Sessions is totally not a lying racist scumbag and I believe 100% of what he says

1|What remake?
0|Oh so, religion.
0|Statistics show that this is the most liberal generation in history.
1|Hey now, look how far Daenerys has come!
1|Were you not there for Jade Helm?
1|What do they know about being president?
1|Yeah, because of the rigging!
1|Yes that fact is a bulletproof defense!
1|Clearly a rigged election
1|You trying to supress his first amendment, bro?
1|The polls that show him losing are rigged by the MSM
0|One word: nationalism.
1|I think she meant November 29th
1|"That's OK, we will show ""Not Without My Daughter"" to educate public about Iranian politics."
1|That's EXACTLY what a shill would say!
0|*Crooked Hillary
1|I'm sure it has *absolutely nothing* to do with the fact that Hillary is not going to prison and *everything* to do with the fact that this sub is filled with shills and liberals, too.
1|I mean, if Britain hadn't lost the Revolutionary War we wouldn't be in this mess right now, so if you really think about it it's your country's fault.
1|"Obviously ""employing illegal immigrants to build his signature building or buying cheap steel from China"" was Clinton's fault!"
1|"Back when ""urban communities"" were great."
1|"That's the first time I've heard someone say, ""maybe it's Trump that's normal!"""
0|Just want your vote to count mate.
1|The lawn signs and Facebook likes tell a different story!
1|How ineffective is the government that they orchestrated a massive tragedy and still failed to fix the underlying problems they claimed caused it
1|Solid 100 day plan...
0|It's like pointing at your 21 year old son and bitching about why he isn't growing a foot a year like his 3 year old niece.
0|That was the real horror that Dave saw when he was traversing universes.
0|so vote and matter and be a constituency or not vote and thereby announce you don't matter, by your choice, and get less of what you want
1|We all know that underinflated footballs are a much bigger threat to the integrity of the game than players who beat their wives and girlfriends.
1|More like Shillery's economists.
0|It has electrolytes!
1|"Because Obama's ""Wal-Mart Death Camps"" and secret police force were thwarted by these brave AMERICAN patriots!"
1|Lol, yeah and Democrats are great human beings who never engage in misconduct or do anything wrong.
1|Well, I was supporting Clinton, but this makes me want to vote for the pussy-grabber, for sure!
1|Maybe we need some trickledown bootstraps to fix all these lazy poor people
1|And owns lunar real estate.
1|Surely you forgot the

1|Those are just words, we have to judge him by his actions.
1|No way, how could someone POSSIBLY alter something as ironclad as an e-mail after the fact?
1|yes set off a trade war with your third largest trading partner, there is no way that can go wrong.
1|Nightime dumbass!
1|My ar15 will totally protect me from a drone fired missile.
1|I am glad the GOP is being so mature about this.
1|Its what the founders would have wanted!
1|But those hearings and investigations didn't end the way *I* wanted them to end, so they must be rigged!
1|It's just locker room talk, chill out
1|Trump is republican (now), therefore he's racist.
0|But playing with trolls is fun once theyre out from under their bridges
1|Yeah but how slow was the recovery!
1|Clearly an unbiased opinion...
0|"Did it say: ""Donald Trump?"""
1|But, they committed a crime and are probably poor, so they are non persons.
1|The money we're going to get from his huge tax cut!
1|Gosh, I can't believe they want them to vote
0|Some parts of our nation are like a 3rd world country, sadly
1|These are the same people who found the Boston Bomber though.
1|It's essential that those who determine public policy have their values rooted in supernatural belief.
1|You forgot the
1|By voting Republican, right?
0|Here we go again with blaming everything on Russia to try and distract away from Hillary's investigation.
0|Grabbed him right by the vuh-chy-nuh
1|DON'T LISTEN TO THIS MAN'S LIBERAL LIES, VOTE TWICE, THEY WON'T GET THROWN OUT AT ALL!
1|I'm sure the warming gods will take into consideration that the Clinton Democrats are at least acknowledging the problem and give us a goodwill gesture of more time for them to not actually do anything about it.

0|False.
0| hysteria is leaking, I see.
0|Good lord.... What delusional world do you people live in?
0|If she ran as a Republican.
0|Well yeah, that's generally how the ransoming thing works...

0|Name one
0|are you intentionally looking for people to copy and paste this response to?
0|That doesn't make him wrong.
0|It was confirmed that he was on a terrorist watch list maintained by the FBI.
0|Anyone even willing to go hunting with the guy earns street cred nowadays.
0|"""Something I read online"" I was kinda hoping the article title was actually what the OP wrote :$)"
0|Go figure, a liberal president isn't electable.
0|Isn't he a democrat?
0|"Can we all stop using the term ""safe space""?"
0|And there it is, the guy who was on a doomed ticket in 2012 becomes president without having to campaign at all
0|I think a bill like this is aimed at intimidating whistleblowers into wasting time figuring out if it violated the first amendment instead of warning people in a timely fashion.
1|Republicans blocked funding for that too
0|He probably should have, considering how far Hillary has consistently thrown him under the bus since lol
0|If you think Reddit reflects the majority of Americans you don't get out much.
0|Be honest: You're not a journalist.
0|We should start building guillotines.
0|CNN wouldn't run that story.
0|What day do they celebrate San Bernadino?
0|What fraction of what Clinton has done did it take to make Nixon resign?
0|President Trump will demand even more.
0|did she mention if she talked about uranium?
0|Gods Guns and Gays the 3 g's of the South I know them well.
1|Maybe not a case but Clinton keeps calling this a review, it's just a review, you don't get that deep of shit for a review.
0|"When Trump said he would send the AG after Hillary (today, I think), several of the top comments were along the lines of ""Wow maybe Trump's actually a great guy"" and ""I might vote for Trump now."""

0|Have a nice day.
0|Yes same reporter
0|RTFA, perhaps?
0|No, PC's are better
0|obstruction of justice, contempt of court.
0|No the Turd way Democrats wish we would just leave the party and go away.
0|Why are Cohen and the person sitting next to him dressed like they're going to Easter church services?
0|Please point out where I said that, quote me even.
0|Too funny!
0|Donald, is that you?
0|"Trump said it, not the mainstream media, or us ""liberals""."
0|Or that she loves him enough to forgive and let it go.
0|I think she's guilty as sin and should rot in a cage somewhere, but I do see a pardon if she's indicted, simply because she would in no way get a fair trial imo.
0|Ohio is done, he should worry about South Carolina and Missouri
0|It's not wide open, illegal migration has been greatly reduced over the last seven years.
0|well stick to the subject fuckface
0|Don't forget Maine!
0|Honest question, what's wrong with Trump?
0|In 08 he was trashing his own city and telling people how great Sarah Palin was.
0|Never about the American people
0|Totally

1|Peace!
0|The only reply your inane position merited.
1|Yeah, but do you have REAL evidence?
0|Speaking as someone in a solidly Democratic state, with Democrats almost in supermajority control of the legislature, on top of the governorship and the courts all the way up to the circuit: It doesn't matter which party's in power, having single party rule is bad, which party it is just changes how it's bad.
0|Sadly, racism and anti-semitism have been staples of conservatism for decades as well.
0|Well what is a swing state depends on the polls and the election because just a few elections ago Virginia was not a swing state at all.
0|That'd make Trump a rapist, that doesn't make Bill Clinton a rapist.
0|Never said anything about laundering it, just that, like most things he has said, it was an empty promise to score political points.
0|All he said was hed like to hear her say something...
0|If someone makes nearly all of their arguments without any basis in fact, then they are not a source worth listening to
1|Nah, Jesus wouldn't like that.

0|This analogy only works if the Sander's restaurant only tells you about amazing 4 star meals for $8.99 but can't actually deliver them
0|They are not heroes.
0|The first amendment does not give the press the right to commit fraud or libel in order to sell their media
1|Yes, someone never having a press conference and laughing at questions, that isn't someone who thinks they're above everyone else

0|Troompa loompas
0|That's a good point but will he see it that way though?
1|Long live the Queen!

1|Because what would be great is even less in the way of the super rich and corrupt to exploit the country
0|Do you honestly think Clinton cares about minorities?
1|Must be all them gun laws working.
0|Kind of like her predecessors made the same conclusion?
0|Not as weak as this one.
0|haha except in 2008?
0|Yeah, we won't exactly know that until 2020, which is what is so scary.
0|Or you know 8 or so years of consistent readership of WaPo and other papers and noticing a abnormal pattern in reporting across the board.

0|To be fair, I'd take 8 more years of W, than four years of Trump, if those were my only two options and I'm a Liberal.
1|The fact it isn't praising Hillary.
0|Have fun in West Virginia.

1|How can you be against it if it's all secret
0|Thanks, I've continued to refine it, since working with Rocky Anderson and the Justice party, last election.

0|Could be the start of the post-Ailes era at Fox.
0|From 55% of the people- not exactly a resounding mandate.
0|I would be fascinated at the link between emphysema and lung cancer because to the best of my knowledge aside from like, always smoking it out of an apple and the carcinogens that come with that I thought the link with lung cancer was dispelled with that one research study where they had people who didn't smoke, smoked only weed, smoked only tobacco, and smoke both and found lung cancer in only the tobacco and both people but I'm both paraphrasing and don't have time to find the source so I deffer to anyone who has the time to correct what I probably got wrong here.
1|"""Statistics"" is a trigger word and covert dog whistle for ""RACIST"""
0|Then you have to overturn the 14th Amendment.
1|It was a mistake, watch your tone.
0|(insert slow sexy music...and a pride of lions).
0|Nope it only got crazier, more obstructionist and accomplished far less substantive policy as a result.
0|Let's see the Clinton foundation tax returns, out even who donated and where the money goes.
0|Wtf
1|Ahh, democracy.
0|That he's not actually a billionaire
1|Yeah cuz only two candidates are running
1|Obvious
1|Just another example of the most transparent politician in history.
1|well obviously those were the only three bad ones, and not the only three bad ones that didnt get deleted out of the 30,000 that were.
0|Not quite sure how you leaped all the way there from my comment.
0|And there was a second shooter on the grassy knoll.
0|Trump and Hillary--The Walrus and the Carpenter.
1|All that republican propaganda getting your head
0|S t r e t c h!
0|Getting most informed voters to vote Clinton is a pretty tough sell too.
1|if you don't support Hillary, you just hate strong women.
0|Oh how quickly a hero can fall when reality does not live up to delusion.
0|Kaine seems fragile and weak, not the best pick to gain white men.
1|And your a great person yourself friend

1|Yeah, this is the only dirt on trump they have.
1| Conspiracy 'Pokemon Go' is a tool devised by the globalist elite to brainwash the millennial masses into obeying statist policies and lifestyle programming.
0|Another reason why she is a better Presidental choice than Hillary Clinton.
1|Typical leftist, elitism right here...
0|"well if you know that then you should also know that he too tried to employ ""how are we losing if we have these big rallies"" approach and then lost in the worst defeat in electoral history"
0|It's still a fairly insignificant part of his hiring practices.
1|You forgot the
0|I think someone is angling for a promotion to replace Katrina Pierson.......
0|Then they don't really give a damn about progressive values, their primary motivation is being anti establishment.
1|Because everyone knows black parents have hypnotic control over their children
1|Yes, I know when I abuse my elected office for monetary favors I always leave a clear written record of what I'm doing and why...
1|Everyone knows there's no amendment before the second amendment!
1|The good trump supporters with guns will shoot the bad black people with guns and it will all be fine.
0|Trump literally said this state issue not federal, states should hold the power to decide.
1|We can be sure the oh so concerned *esquire* has covered the whiteness of the US Government in the past.
0|Doesn't make it any less damning, especially when running for the highest office.
0|"Lol like when he said that Bernie's ""pathetic"" revolution is over?"
1|You mean someone was better than Duck Dynasty?
0|Republicans where *not* happy with Harriet Miers.
0|Because you have to count the delegates, nominate a candidate, and write the parties platform.
0|Yes
0|sanders should have dropped out?

0|Don't insult chimpanzees like that, bro.
1|And miss the chance to have a nude model as first lady?
0|Just read the above comment in Mac's voice and yours in Frank's.
0|Also known as George W. Bush's brother, Marvin.
0|This is funny and not at all surprising.
0|How did you determine it was plagiarism?
0|I was just going off the comments in this thread...can't say I know many Trump supporters in the real world.
0|Even though the schadenfreude of it all will be funny at first, it'll become another highly focused hate based sub on par with coontown or KotakuInAction.
0|This kind of attitude from his supporters (and supported by him, saying people not voting for him are just misinformed, ignorant or stupid) is just another reason I voted for Hillary against Sanders in the primary.
1|Maybe he is pissed off about how bad the Browns are...
1|I am crushed to hear this is a made up story, crushed and shocked
0|"Seriosuly, ""Clinton"" had been said more times than ""Trump."""
1|Now that Trump has the nomination officially, he can stop being so inhibited and speak freely what is on his mind.
1|Probably just some mid level manager, I'm sure.
1|Not when you're a woman.
1|"You forget ""Innocent until proven guilty"" is for everyone but Hillary."
1|Shit like this is definitely how we move forward.
1|I'm very certain that Donald Trump was personally overseeing all rental applications.
1|Must be those violent leftist we keep hearing about.
1|Really surprised at the thumbnail next to the thread title
0|Right, because obviously the lizard is Cheney and by process of elimination..
1|And as Kasich you would trust Trump based on his long history of dependability, consistency, and honesty?
1|In the police, you're an ace sniper if you hit what you're aiming at more than you miss.
1|Donald's got the best doctors, he can just try again in 8 years.
1|More voter suppression from the Clinton campaign, how typical
1|Yes yes this is good for bitcoin
1|Why, he has God beside him.
1|That's why he has Mike Pence.
1|Wow, great rebuttal to the substantive points in the article, which I'm sure you read.
1|Its true, corporations make their billions of dollars cause they'll just flip the table over now and then and watch their employees scramble.
1|The feelings of people who might be taken over by a government that is actually somewhat effective is reason enough to put the rest of the world before ourselves
0|So court =WWE confirmed.
0|his appearance on Daily Show recently was pretty funny as well, if not amiable
1|Yea how awful have the last 8 years been, versus the 8 before them
0|I'm sure there's a plethora of qualified minorities that are itching to be interns for the GOP.
1|Just the brown ones
1|thanks obama
0|Why do you think that there aren't things you don't know about Trump?
1|Nah, Bernie said Trump's as broke as everybody else, so he must be!
1|Well, we all know that Clinton's has been rock solid
1|So when Bill Clinton's account show up on Ashley Madison we can say it was that hacker, 4chan, who did it?
0|Show me the parenthesis hysteria.
0|I agree
1|Yea, not because of Hillary being a flawed candidate or anything.
0|What worked in past elections isn't going to work this time around.
0|That's one thing- we could always run for office en mass and once elected jerk the party left and keep it there for the next 40-50 years
1|Thanks for correcting the record.
0|Bernie 2020, sponsored by hindsight.
1|well the good news is that all his supporters are just following suit and supporting Hillary now.
0|So you didn't read the e-mails then?
0|You almost got it but try again
0|We gave our word to defend other free nation and Donald wants to make us liars and to help Putin conquer other nations and take away people's liberties sick!
0|Trump's whole campaign in six words.
1|Yeah because if anything makes sense this election, it's that Sanders should be more like Ted Cruz
1|Yeah Trump can keep us safe
0|This is correct.
1|Yeah, because the topic of a candidate's religion never gets brought up otherwise
1|"Ah yes thanks for injecting some clarity here, ""Reality says"" indeed"
1|Not sure if
0|Just like when Clinton's 'unwavering' supporters voted for Obama 8 years ago.
1|Hillary should do the honorable thing and step aside so Bernie can be the nominee.
1|Yes, because he is totally going to do all of those things
0|It always has to be a white person otherwise it is race pandering?
0|I love how people are ok with spending our tax money on wars rather than educating, feeding, and keeping our own citizens healthy.
0|That's some harsh language to not have an explanation why you'd call us that.
0|Yes, Hillary is also terrible though.
0|This is my new favorite quote.
0|Dude that kid that found the nazi flag in his attic can never run for president now.
1|That would make them racist.
0|And last week was what, 95% anti-Hillary?
0|I love the meltdown Bernie groupies have here on reddit :)))
0|Condi Rice and Colin Powell absolutely did not have private servers built in their house.
1|Literally Hitler
1|Yea, I believe you.
1|I think he forgot this:
0|her stances on abortion, affirmative action, pretty much all social issues, her tax plan, her infrastructure spending plan, her stance on climate change, her stance on criminal justice reform, her stance on paid leave, her stance on universal pre-k and a host of other issues.
1|They've been so honest all election so I don't know why you're suddenly skeptical.
0|Or ambassador to somewhere warm and tropical.

1|As a Newyorker, I'm just astonished that there are other states that have things to talk about.
1|I'm sure she can't sleep at night
0|Unfortunately he's being serious lol
0|I thought the police were already shielded?
0|Fair.
0|"Yeah, after the ""investigation"" it'll show we all owe her 200 Million or so"
0|did you look at the link?
1|Well in that case there's not a single candidate I like, I guess I should not vote
0|If you think white males will escape the disaster Trump will be, you're living in a fantasy land.
1|Reality has a well known shill bias
0|So you are conceding that Hillary kept US secrets on an unsecured personal server?
1|SURPRISED!

0|FDR ring a bell?
1|GUYS SHE'S THE MOST TRANSPARENT POLITICAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY!
0|Except Bernie supported the Soviet Union...
1|yeah man, those University of Phoenix degrees really pay for themselves!
1|But clearly Hilary is fine with her husband screwing around with underage girls, and older girls, and presumably any other girls that Bill feels the need to play around with, so why should anyone else possibly care ?
1|How come CNN isn't covering this?
1|You should still kneel at Hillary's heels because Donald is worse!
1|Well so did Obamacare so how dare you question Obama's legs y
1|Yeah, sounds like it was terribly close.
1|Or they are hoping the Sanders people get drunk and start fights so the DNC can, with righteous indignation, kick them out.

0|He is a mormon.
1|what a thoughtful retort
1|NYT, WaPo, and HuffPo are in the tank for Trump.
1|They have been flipping off the Sanders voters from the beginning why would they stop.
1|Anyone but Bernie Sanders and his commie voters.
1|Here, you dropped this-
1|surely it is one or the other, because there is no way POTUS could be working on more than one thing at time.
1|But what they write just FEELS so right!
1|I'm sure all that money will go to help the homeless.
1|Neither are the Jews, stay safe fellow fascist.
0|But it wouldn't hurt to try a little.
0|And Sanders wants to give all humans and other animals citizenship?
1|He brings out the best in people, doesn't he?
1|Marco Rubio it is.
0|Bernie responds by...wait for it...also not outline his foreign policy, doesn't attack trump, and brings up her Iraq vote.
0|Right swing conspiracy
1|yeah, Venezuela is such a successful socialist utopia, that its favor trumps that of the United States.

1|Oh, I'm sure her memory will be spotless and she will tell all.
0|Doesn't wanna piss of Bernie supporters anymore.
0|You are awesome and I hope you never give up.
1|Coolio, we can all hope that all the moderates and independents will treat Clinton fairly during the fall because she's innocent until proven guilty.
1|I'm sure her charity will fund the assaults
1|The politicians themselves would of course be enlisted as well, because they're all patriotic Americans, right?
0|At least they'll have to try harder.
1|Yea, Trump's going to be more careful about what he says in the future.
1|doesn't matter they hate Clinton so they're very reliable
0|Everyone knows Americas worst enemy is its people

1|You know there is something going on.
1|No man it's just that Harvard is yet another a bought out Clinton shill factory.
1|Federal laws shouldn't take away the state's right to choose if black people get to vote.
0|It's interesting that you can try to call out Trump supporters and trash talk them however if the same was done towards Hillary supporters a ban would be issued.
1|Exactly what we are seeing in Colorado!
1|It's a Chinese conspiracy!
1|What are you talking about Trump is a beacon of human integrity, intelligence and honesty!

1|Good thing Sotomayor is a God fearing strong libertarian that wants to restore the constitution and bring back small government!
1|Paradise!
0|His girth certificate says otherwise, but rumors are that it was forged.
1|We should open up those libel laws
1|Damn those libruls and their knife control!
0|Checkmate
0|Because when people actually read the full text of the emails, and not a few words without context, people realize that they're boring and the claims outlandish.
1|Good thing that has no chance of escalating tensions with China.
0|Some, I assume... are good people.
0|But when video surfaces of Trump and Putin in bed together (literally), and it's actually sweet, the Trump caricature is softened even as he is escorted to jail.
0|How about instead of the stupid 2 party system we employ Runoff Voting?
1|Everyone's got a right to privacy, unless your name is John Podesta!
0|Honestly I just wish they would drop there ass backward views on social issues so we had 2 political parties to choose from.
1|Probably just like the, if not more, insane roller coaster and bombshells they've put on us this month.
0|It is amazing!
1|"Not to mention your tiny population since no one wants to live in ""whacky"" California... obligatory"
1|Well, if you were smart, you'd find a way to avoid it.

1|Who needs email security when you got the Russians on your side?
1|The dirty esjay-doubleyou thought police have gone too far!
1|Yeah, the Republicans would have totally rolled up their sleeves and helped pass any Sanders legislation.

1|Why would they look to silence somebody that's posting faked emails put out by Russia?
1|This will swing the election.
0|He's been pretty sane outside of his own show I think.
1|If we kill everyone, we'll end all war!
1|But again, government needs to be dismantled because everything they do is inept.
1|This is just a foreshadowing of the excellent programming The Trump News Network is going to bring.
1|But he was trying to decide between Meatloaf and Gary Busey, that's clearly the same thing
0|"UGH.. When Hillary talked about her 30 year record and then Donald Trump responded with how he built his company and then the quote ""if we could run our country the way I've run my company"" she should have instantly responded ""By bankrupting it multiple times?"""
0|He probably got away with groping women around NYC for decades because after feeling his tiny grip, the women kept looking for the baby molesting people on the subway.
1|Yep, the FBI typed up a legal document that implicate Clinton, but forget to charge her for it then release that document to the public, but genius investigators manage to find it.
1|Maybe he thought that, since Hillary has evil in her heart, it was his time to show the light of God inside of his.
1|The best wife is a subservient one that is barefoot and naked in the kitchen and never speaks unless spoken to, amiright?

1|just another liberal shill!
1|Fuck you, he's a reddit HERO because he took down Gawker, how DARE you besmirch his name.
0|You can thank Alex Jones and his Bohemian Club conspiracy for the Molach bullshit.
1|Ok I guess California will vote red in this election.
1|I'm sure Jesus would vote for rapists and racists.
0|And let's not forget Donna Brazile passing off CNN town hall questions to the Clinton Campaign, then becoming head of the DNC~!
1|"Uhh I think you mean ""good business"""
1|Nooo we're not allowed to draw obvious comparisons between Trump and dictators of the past because that's just liberal hyperbole
0|Yikes, someone must have insulted his tiny hands during that conference call
1|How could 9/11 have happened when Rudy said there was no international terrorism before Obama?
0|I guess Donna Brazile and Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn't do anything unethical, then did they?
1|It doesn't matter who violated your rights or did something illegal as long as the evidence can be twisted to show what I want
1|So fuck it all and burn it to the ground I guess?
1|Her lack of criminal record despite so many investigations is proof of guilt.
1|Great I hope she uses her brains to continue foreign intervention, the drug war, and sell favors to Wall St.
1|They each got a few hundred ballots to fill out too
1|That's not a biased headline at all
1|They can't vote... what's one more injury to their rights?
1|Yeah, Trump's the victim in all this.
0|And, with the herding of the polls, Clinton's lead is narrowing.
1|Nothingburger.
1|You're missing the
0|Considering that Trump seems to be Bernie's antithesis, I can't say that statement makes any sense.
0|Wasn't there was one who actually got shot IIRC and they still got off?
1|Because we're the ones that label supporters for the other candidate Nazis, klansmen, racists, sexists, xenophobes, and rednecks.
1|Yeah, that's not suspicious at all.
1|No the Russians just didn't allow them to tell him.
1|Maybe they forgot
1|I'm voting for Stein for her thoughts on 9/11 being an inside job
1|Lock her up!

0|Splitting hairs in a turd sandwich...

0|I'm in AC and he is despised here almost as much as Trump.
0|Quality.
0|As it pertains to criminal law, yes, I do think requiring mens rea is the standard and language pertaining to it is in most criminal law statutes.
0|not really an accomplishment seeing how there are 298 responses and not one of them mentioned anything like that.
0|Get back to us when it is 6 in 10.
0|Best speech of 1945
0|and if they're Democrats, their parents still voted for Hillary while the young adult men voted for Sanders ... go figure.
0|I guess they're worried about the image of our nation with a racist silver spooner in the white house
0|i thought i was being acute
0|I think my past few posts address that question.
0|As much as I disagree with the sentiment (because I think Americans are generally great people) I'm fairly confident that if Trump wins it will be written off as 'those dumb Americans being dumb again'.
0|Except for pizza, which he eats with a fork.
1|Everybody knows that ABC is part of the vast right wing conspiracy.
0|Hillary has never had the authority to order any kind of killings.
0|Has Clinton ever done anything without scandal attached?
1|It's just an interview!
1|BUT HE CANT CONFIRM IT!
0|No one fucking cares what Manthrax Coulter says.
0|Exactly.
0|"Why are sexual assault accusations suddenly described as the much more mundane ""cheating""?"
0|i heard if he makes hillary unviable in all states he has this in the bag
1|Advertising a sale to Jews...clever marketing

0|A thousand little cracks
0|True dat.
0|Perfect=/ great
0|Headline shows that editors can write no good as real journalist.

0|It's bizarro world when generally more 'educated' democrats are so ignorant as to not get out and vote.
0|"I agree in general with your points, but just as an aside, it's ""runs the gamut""."
1|Because owning a gun is the same as molesting children.
0|Of course his win only matters if Clinton loses as I'm sure Clinton will reward DWS with some cushy position in DC.
0|Which you refuse to cite
0|No
0|he won't answer simple questions and is in deep denial, not worth bothering with.
0|Their new enemy is the post election Trump Breitbart media group.
0|It's an FBI investigation dude.
0|Same as it ever was.

0|So they thought with Ron Paul
1|It should have worked exactly the same but the reality should have been different so I could get indictment
0|He certainly had some odd statements.
0|Did she ever claim she did?
0|Hell trump even did it in 79.
0|I appreciate the honesty.
0|put respect on his name.
0|Or ye shall be brought to heel.
0|Haven't the Clintons collected enough power in politics?
0|Ive heard all the trump arguments before you wont say anything new youre just on your knees like all the other trump supporters
0|Except here we're not even compromising with people we're in great agreement with already.
0|Well you can't trust the lamestream media, you gotta get your confirmation bias straight from the... bull's mouth?
1|THE FBI IS SMARTER THAN ALL THE REDDITORS COMBINED
0|The fact that Clinton is running for President is irrelevant to whether she broke the law.
1|Deleting emails and wiping them in a fashion never allowing them to be recovered was clearly not obstructing justice
1|But it's a policy of the *venue* and the RNC obviously could do no research to find a venue with policies that better reflect their core values.
1|"A man lying down with hands up is shot by police but police violence isn't an actual issue and ""stop killing people that don't need to be killed"" isn't a call for action."
1|Yes, big words like exculpatory are indicative of GOP theatre and grandstanding.
1|Well yeah, but Bud doesn't count as real beer, duh

0|hahahaha this delusion
0|So that's what, five votes for Trump?
1|Yes, HRC turned around decades of foreign policy to give weapons to Saudi Arabia.
1|That must have been a really good hooker.

0|You might have misspelled 'rape'.
1|Yep all those white people in Korea and Japan making technological advances

0|And finishing for the camera man.
0|He's a senator that is actually coming out and trying to have fun.
1|You forgot how bad Rap music and porn is for people

0|Well the ROI is immense
0|The elusive top kek.
1|But Trump said they would protect LGBT community and the convention cheered.

0|Then they'll use pressure cookers or attack daycares or whatever else they can think of.
1|He just goes out of his way to compliment Putin for murdering journalists, excuse Hussein for gassing civilians, admire Erdogan's response to the failed coup, and cite China's response tl the Tienanmen Square democracy protests as strong governance, but, yeah, he doesn't give of dictator-y vibes at all
1|Yeah, racist paleoconservatism only got legitimated through Trump's campaign and hasn't been a hallmark of the Republican party since 1968, sure
1|Targeting jews on the internet is totally different from targeting jews in real life.
0|Congrats on being the world's shittiest detective.
0|I forgot common sense isn't so common...if you can't see it, it clearly doesn't exist.
1|Moderate indies are an anathema.
1|But a Trump presidency will force the DNC to move left
0|That isn't foreign aid
0|or pick the third party...
1|What a retard
0|"I thought I remembered reading somewhere that there was a ""code"" for something, but they intentionally set it to ""0000"" because they figured the chances of forgetting the code in an emergency were greater than the chances of someone trying to break it."
1|Because there are no third parties and we're all a bunch of lazy fucks
1|This Clinton lady sounds like a real class act
0|Want to take a guess as to how many of those were politically motivated?
1|So steamy

0|Catholic, Mormon &amp; Latino.
0|She said she'll stop when everyone else stops too
1|Sounds like something a Russian would say.
0|One he could have just as well vetoed
1|Because it matters so much more than our sick corrupted democracy!
1|This is another set of 'unfortunate mistakes' that she is learning from... This helps make her the best candidate ever since she is learning soo much..
0|A plan to reduce the size of your paycheck/take home by increasing social security tax, that should help pay the bills eh?
0|Ideally, but I see very few people actually talking about cost control.
0|Oh they know, they just prefer to hide their cards for blackmail.
1|Why would the Clinton News Network ever change the narrative of the people?
1|DWS acted alone.
0|I didn't hear a cheer for Trump.
0|Those state governments happen to be comprised of people who are both state representatives as well as delegates and superdelegates for the DNC...
0|Well if you can change your gender you may as well be able to change your ethnicity.
1|Oh yes, because interventionist neocons are so much worse than literal white supremacists
1|Yes, clearly I totally stifled his freedom of speech by dressing him down.
0|Of course she is....she is a young girl she didn't memorize a 5 minute speech
1|Nothing about a woman president that's for sure
1|See, everything's better now.
1|"""My Candidate Is A She"" isn't a message?"
0|They must have been tipped off by her SS detail.
0|did you reply to the wrong comment here?

0|You mean after she vehemently supported it and picked a VP who actively supports it?
0|Why would you ever want to put a corrupt criminal like Clinton in office?
0|With redditgold no less
0|TIL being a corporate puppet is centrist
0|Not even Obama, Bernie had a chance to denounce the corrupt system that screwed him but he just accepted it.
1|But Jews aren't American so they're not eligible.
1|He's a true progressive
0|Nah, Him and Castile were pretty fucked up cases.
1|That's racist.
1|Yeah that's exactly what he said
0|"Someday in the future there will be on display in The Smithsonian an orange-stained noose with a placard reading ""How Not To Run A Presidential Campaign."""
1|You sound like a commie to me
1|He wants to tax us at 99% and give away all the free stuffs!
1|That's racist
0|But it *feels* like a holiday tree.
1|Oh yeah, she's totally qualified to be President
1|Because Putin loves America so much, he just wants us to elect the strongest and most capable person.
1|I'm sure Hillary will explain all of this away at her next press conference.

0|Try reading it yourself before smearing it in an attempt to get others not to read it.
1|Why don't you people realize that it was the Russians.
1|Well, there was that picture of Heidi/Michelle with Lee Harvey Oswald.
0|I'm sure if you keep copy/pasting this into every thread Trump will surely win the election.

1|Yup, that's sure gonna help get my vote.
0|Are you black?
0|You're right, he'd actually become Skeletor within 3 months.
1|but still better than Hillary, right guys?
0|Cheeto Muskrat Grande is Trump's wrestling name.
1|60 out of about 2500... Wow just awful
1|No, she is anti-vaccines, that is why you must vote for Hillary
1|He's not even President and he's already fulfilling his campaign promises
0|Then she should have no problems releasing her papers.
0|It confirmed my suspicion even if they have something meaningful to say related to their headline, I wouldn't care enough about the topic itself to slog through an article written by someone who shares space with pixelly nips.
0|Don't feed the trolls
0|But... But... Po-kay-mawn go to the polls?
1|Apple!
1|He's staunchly and consistently pro-American - unlike Clinton, who clearly hates America.
0|I'd put my money on there being a few aborted Trump babies, supporting your claim.
1|Nixon did a good job ending the war.
1|"But... but... they're ""the party of Lincoln""!"
1|Comey is obviously Russian.
1|But I thought the MSM was in the pocket of Clinton ...
0|That's what I'm saying :)
0|"Apparently she ""would not put herself in a position to be sexually harassed in the way that Fox News chief Roger Ailes is accused of doing"""
1|All billionaires are shills - except for Trump, he's a self-made man
0|You can't make this stuff up.
0|He has been this stupid since the beginning, it's just now that it's just him and Hillary  politics has turned on him more than ever before, so you'll see more of these threads.
0|And 9/11
0|Honestly it kinda almost seems like Assange is pro Trump
0|I'm appalled by all of this, and if you shush me one more time *I will put you in the ground*!
1|They should let him debate, and then just censor him out for any of the states where he's below 15%
0|And ssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
0|Do you have a grasp which branch of the government Attorney General belongs to?
1|Well, she's not Mexican, so she's exempt
0|Option one is still a 3rd degree felony because, he registered where he doesn't live
0|The gap closes 10% but he only has to gain 5%, therefore he lost by 5% Which again, is not a blowout
0|I was trying to say that it isn't completely one sided as this thread makes it out to be.
1|Nice that he brought up scandals against Phelps.
1|Yeah, but they're nearly offset by Pussissippi, which is 100% Hillary.
0|Oh man, that was fucking beautiful.
1|Yea fuck all the regular employees trying to do their job
0|I looked and I saw what I thought I would see.
0|If you are talking cancer and heart disease risk, there's a link, but crime, intelligence, and other moral disorders are overwhelmingly an artifact of social, not genetic, forces and flat out prejudice.

0|I swear by Allah and the 72 virgins I get when I finish my mission that I am not a terrorist!
0|Actually, he would've won more **votes**, but fewer delegates (probably less than 50%).
1|So your grandparents were evading paying taxes for the yardwork that you were doing, shame.
0|The political dynasties need to help each other out in trying times.
1|Ah CNN, the most reputable and un-biased of news sources
0|The bushes and the clintons are two political dynasties on opposite sides of the fence, and Trump is an outsider, I'm not very shocked.
1|Right like I'm going to listen to the guy that's wrong 9% of the time!
0|Translation: Republicans are worried about running/losing against this guy in the future, so they're smearing him now.

1|If you can't present Solutions that are Final, how will you answer the Black/Muslim Question?
1|Because business leaders are the ones we look to for morals and ethics
0|We have age limits for guns too, which has its own amendment.
1|We're talking about whites an hispanics though
1|Hillary can but only if Goldman pays her to
1|Because either of them would have created such a large surplus right?

1|So that's why she's supporting Biden's initiative!
1|What a gem of a human being.
1|Which just proves the point that they ARE being oppressed!

1|Hillary is a duck confirmed?
1|Good, the guy who matches few policies with Sanders.
1|Just ban guns, so criminals don't have guns!

0|You mean the birth certificate issue Obama had that Clinton started back in '08?
1|Clearly, Hillary has infiltrated deep into the Oregon government and conspired to send nonpartisan ballots to all Sanders supporters.
0|What did you study?
0|You are correct, but, I am curious if people would have voted differently if it didn't *appear* that Bernie was losing due to super delegates from day one.

1|LOL but Bernie running in a state with lots of guns, for 30+ years maintaining a spot in the government running against republicans over and over, yeah, he has never been attacked, will CRUMPLE against trump.

1|Yeah, good thing Hillary isn't into starting wars
0|So are you in a lose lose scenario here or do you want Hillary to win?
1|Well that makes her half immigrant everyone knows that.
1|But that would make the government have too much control over us!
1|Yeah, this sub totally isn't biased or close-minded.
1|Such an original joke
1|Being crooked!
1|Another example of Trump supporters being oppressed.
1|Yeah man - now if only Jimmy Fallon could raise good points while still being wacky and likable!
0|But the whole country needs to become my safe space!
0|She'd be white and be advocating gun rights.
1|Damn those Democrats for rigging the primaries so the person with the most votes ended up winning the nomination.

1|Hahaha yeah, especially compared to the other candidates
0|no u
0|And I thought Sanders had crazy low support from blacks.
0|Who is the least establishment candidate who stands a chance at winning?
0|Nobody should be unhappy with Obama.
0|we got that with your extremely weak defense the lies told be vets for bernie
0|no he invited the information to be released, thats not the same as saying hey go hack Hillary.
0|no he is going to open a bakery and buy lots of white flour

1|Because they're politicians and they're better than us
0|Right, and I'm sure people will still be wearing MAGA hats in late November.
0|Which he didn't...
0|Most of them dislike Clinton and were willing to listen to Sanders because they want anything other than her.
0|Retaining classified information after you stop working for the government is a criminal offense.
0|I'm waiting for him to demand he get paid to appear in debates
0|I have this fantasy that congress is like the Shin Megami Tensei : Persona series.
0|The man knows how to stay in the spotlight doesnt he?

0|I think you have your dates mixed up.. Boomers in 1980 were between 16 and 34
0|Movements of ambassadors isn't classified
0|Care to point out the last election when someone called another candidate's wife ugly and accused his father of being involved in the assassination of a previous president?
0|Trump was the one who thought to reach out to latinos by eating Taco salad.
0|Because Clinton isn't a crazy person, and hanging out in r./EnoughTrumpSpam doesn't require me to hang out with racists like Milo the way R/TheDonald users have to.
0|When you have money up the wazoo, enough to protect yourself.
1|Hey, it works for Trump.
1|but no I'd rather have the fascist former businessman with no governing experience as president
0|Funny coming from you.
0|And Clinton avoided using such services willfully by instead putting her email on a server in her basement instead of on SIPRnet like everyone else.

0|any pictures/video from the RNC?

0|Theirs, and OURS.
1|So let's elect her POTUS!
0|And i'm pretty sure someone somewhere along the line informed her she might be recieving sensative info, and probably signed a document saying she coukd be recieving sensative info through email...
1|Yeah, we all know how incumbents have to fight tooth and nail to get reelected.
0|These Russian shills should spend more on their linguists and less on bought upvotes.
0|She should have thought about that before she decided to play silly buggers with classified intel.
0|Who is lecturing you?
0|Unless the debates are held in a reddit AMA or on his twitter account, I doubt he will.
0|My point is that we don't have a choice that isn't a clear danger to this country
0|Which also means she had classified information as a private citizen
0|You can't prove me wrong.
0|Well, with Donald Trump we get Mad Men and with Hillary we get House of Cards.
1|You can't prove she *intended* to be Secretary of State tho
1|But look how active she's already getting congress to be!
0|My definition is the same as Trumps Get it?
1|Only because he didn't really want to win
0|come on now...the field wasn't really that stellar
1|Well hell hand her the keys to the presidency.
0|The whole reason it's in the constitution is for traditionally unlawful purposes, though.
1|oh you mean like Patreaus?

0|Yea, I'm with ya' on that Neglectful_Stranger, the people in this sub are- - - - HEY, look up there, more Obummer Chemtrails!
1|Sending work emails from a personal account and raping people is totally the same thing.
1|And now superdelegates are just fine.
1|Oh, yes, because there's absolutely no pressure to bring a bill to the floor when the acting president endorses a social/political movement for one.
0|I think it was an inevitability when Truman desegregated the armed forces, tbh.
1|It's hardly my fault their parents are godless liberal homos who don't watch Fox News.
0|He didn't say that, he said they couldn't 100% prove that she broke it with criminal intent.
1|or, unlikely though it may sound, she may just lie.... I mean, its not something that Hilary would do, since she is a consistently transparent, honest and civic minded individual, but she may choose to distort the truth slightly....
1|Isnt it fun when it serves your SJW purpose?
0|"Since the rise of the tea party it's been, ""Government doesn't work, continue to elect us so we can prove our point by breaking it further."""
0|It says a lot about Hillary Clinton if she cannot focus on Trump and Sanders at the same time.

1|Because emails are worse than billions of people dying.
1|Pussies and their scientific facts!
0|Probably said it more than the troops or military too.
0|Why are you against Gary Johnson?
1|Unlike Hillary were most were voting for her based on educated assumptions and research.
0|I never said anything about the DNC, just that Bernie has no realistic shot at winning.
0|"Or people don't really want to vote for a woman who is proud that she's *merely* ""grossly negligent"" rather than actually criminal."
0|seems way too much like false advertising
0|It's the world's smallest, classiest and most luxurious violin playing just for him.

1|Chelsea Clinton 2020!
0|I agree, Ted Cruz is dangerously fucking insane.

0|Also while Western Europe was in the Dark Ages, the Middle East kept knowledge of Aristotle and others alive, contributed to math and astronomy (our number system IS the arabic system).
0|And then the really long shitty part comes after the election...
0|And replaces the liberal wing with a fresh set of 40 year olds
0|Probably the same concept behind why straight men have lesbian fantasies/watch lesbian porn.
0|It's funny, because outside of discussing the environment conservatives usually crow about how bad things are.
1|What an awesome presidential candidate - blames everything on everyone else.
0|it doesn't hide on mobile

1|Maybe she's the one woman whom he didn't harass and she feels jaded.

1|It's impossible as no plagiarism occurred.
0|Like Romney, Kasich, Cruz etc., who even though they hate Trump, refuse to vote for Hillary.

1|My Trump Steak says Kansas, China... It smells kinda catty...
1|He can relate to their polygamist sensibilities
0|That's why Sanders lost because he thought all issues in America can be simplified to class.
0|Except that stating the 2nd amendment doesn't protect and individual's rights to own a gun isn't centrist at all.

1|It's obviously a conspiracy bro.
1|Yea but Reagan was a god
1|But you see, Sanders is sincere in his support while Bill and Hillary were just playing the long con!
1|Its Trumpets, not trumpies, duh
1|Yes, because him winning clearly isn't news
1|That would explain his 83% approval rating in Vermont.
1|Yeah, the Nordic model is so, so broken...
1|Because the corrupt shitstains that are Clinton and Trump are so much better.
1|I'm so surprised that our models put together using last generation tech didn't pan out.
1|I agree, I think that would be very informative.
0|He would maintain the Wall Street status quo and wouldn't steal the Republican party like Cruz.
0|Not an idiotic question when the media h as been talking it up for two years now, are still talking it up.

0|Have you guys seen anything about Dimitri Cherny running to replace Mark Sanford in SC?
0|If Sanders got some news coverage at 11... that would be great
0|then why does she lie?
1|Because obviously there is no way that a 17 year old can make an informed decision, unlike an informed experienced 18year old adult, amirite?
0|Trump is a really dangerous candidate for hillary because he is an antithesis to her; gritty, brutally honest, unpolished, no governement experience.

1|If only all those BernieBros weren't brigading the polls
1|Well, I am sure you know Obama better than his former press secretary.
0|Quite alright!

0|Honest to God didn't even know Trump U was a thing until he was running, haha That said, my degree is from an actual university, lol
1|The only reason she's supporting Clinton apparently is 'she has the right genitalia, and Bernie is too old' What a rational thought out reason to vote for someone
1|Oh wow what a moderate position!
0|Its like the GOP hasnt learned anything either.

0|"""Well I guess that's what everybody else is getting..."""
0|Everyone knows which side gets manbearpig
1|Joe did a great job stumping for McCain, I'm sure Trump is pumped about this endorsement

0|Those gosh darndest Bernie Bros with their fox trots and flat tops
0|Is political affiliation a protected class when it comes to rentals?
1|Yeah its not like he's using sources to explain how one thought led to another.

0|Or people vote for who they know
0|Edgy.

0|I don't know your source, but I'll agree to disagree.
0|Nice argument
0|Nah, money in politics doesnt work but obviously Sanders doesnt use it.
0|"In case you are wondering, ""Neoliberal"" means conservative policies like austerity, small government, privatization and low regulation."

0|The harm is the idiots that keep donating to the point where they hurt themselves.

0|Little did he know that 1984 wasn't meant to be a how to guide...
0|What I want to know is if the MSM is putting out the spin that the Wisconsin results mean voter backlash against Donald Trump, can we assume, if Bernie Sanders wins, there is similar voter backlash against Hillary Clinton?
0|Well considering Hillary already has a record of doing things I *don't* want done then taking my chances would be the safe bet.
0|Do they?

0|It's almost as if Reddit is a collection of different groups of people that have differing opinions and the one you happen to hear at any given time is the one shouting the loudest.
1|Yea, them cucks is stoopit.
1|Right, because its coear the more center candidate is picking up independent support.
1|TIL, you should be invited to respond to comments.
0|It's almost like if literally hundreds of thousands of registered voters weren't purged from the system in that area he might have won
0|I like  WashingtonInsideHer

0|I knew liberals were racist, what with their hate for black rifles!
0|The fact that you think national polls matter proves you know nothing about the primary election.
1|That's a well thought out position you have there.
1|Trump would never lie or change his story
1|Yes, because she made such good decisions when she was in Congress.
1|Lol Connecticut FTW
1|They usually vote the wrong way anyways.
0|It's funny because I think Clinton has a better shot at winning the primary but Bernie has the better shot at becoming president.
0|Let me rephrase: They want the ability to say what they want to say without being controlled by either media interests or POTUS's agenda.

1|The one who says Bernie supporters are right-wing is totally not a shill, whatever you say.
1|Nice job guys, real awesome revolution youre starting here.
1|Ah yes, because a single party communist state is what the United States would become under Bernie.
1|Yep, extreme unpopularity is exactly how being right works in a democracy.

1|What a mature and well-constructed rant..
1|Yeah, opinion polling is super useless...
1|Yes this sub is Hillary central am I right
1|No no she later added per capita at the end of her statement a few days later so its ok now.
0|Yeah and those Verizon strikers should switch to t-mobile before they go on strike.
0|Because splitting the Democratic/progressive/liberal vote i n 2 ensures a Republican win unless Trumps party overlords take a piss on him and boot him out so that he runs independent, which would allow Sanders the ability to run independent as well, but that's gambling with a sure victory for the dems.

1|Well at least they're getting suspended!
1|No, no, no, it didn't effect $Hillary, so it doesn't count.
1|Yea cause im sure a 74 year old just loves campaigning 12+ hours daily
1|Is your interest blowing up America?
0|It's more flattering than thinking they actually think she's the direction the Democratic Party should be going in.

1|Must be paid bernie shills!
0|I meant in the news, but we know this is shortlived.

1|But but.. Correct the record!
1|The calendar is favorable to sanders though
1|Informed voters do.
0|If trump gets the republican nomination, the gop dies right then and there.
1|Because Bernie supporters are sexist too, right?
1|Because a more diverse congress allowed those dirty LGBT people same sex marriage, colored people the right to vote, and women the permission to leave the house.
1|You are being toyed with.
1|Yeah those black voters will surely continue the same turnout as in 2008 &amp; 2012 but for a white candidate, and Republican women will just suddenly turn into Democrats because Trump said some stupid comments.
1|Yes, your opinion is fact.
1|Yeh, I'll hold my breath waiting for corporations to do what is in best interest of the US.
1|yeah fuck those Native Americans SJWs offended by someone insulting their own heritage
1|If you look at who voted for Democrats before 1948 and after 1964, yeah it changed the entire party, but who cares, this country's historical lineage says it's just a proxy state for the British empire anyway

1|We could publicly admit the need for Militia incuded in the U. S. Constitution was predicated by the need to suppress any rebellion by those grateful to be enslaved black folks.
1|Hearsay and conjecture allows for a lot more freedom in speech.

0|Supporting BLM may be one of the most regressive things possible

1|Yup he is no different than stalin and will take everything you own bypassing our check and balance system and never risk getting impeached

1|You're all sexist for not supporting the candidate with a vagina.

1|You forgot the
1|We can only hope.

1|But we must revere the job creators for they give us our livelihood
1|Well it's rigged, don't you know.
0|Bernies reaction compared to Hillarys says everything you need to know about the candidates
0|Except for the fact he screwed up Florida economically.
0|polls don't mean shit if people don't show up to vote
1|Clearly they considered Bernie Sanders the front runner at that time.
1|But that makes it a lot harder to afford payments on a house that's twice as large as I need.
1|Obviously the problem is that Democrats haven't been running far enough and fast enough from progressive values.
1|Yeah, but it was great for those living above ground Definitely
1|Profiting off the catastrophic events.
1|Well, in Carson's defense...they both sank with all hands lost.... Definitely

0|What about 1912?
0|Technically, if you enter the country illegally, you are a criminal.
0|He's outright said before that if he were to run for president it would be as a Republican because their voter base is uninformed, uneducated, and easily won over
1|And we are very concerned what you think.
1|...let's dismiss him and call him old and senile and Communist.
1|Because she's a woman in a system dominated by men obviously.
1|Rubio seems focused on issues that matter.
1|Because the title is all the information I need to make a judgement
1|She was at the Bernie rally to meet some guys and they convinced her to go on a mission.

0|He voted yes on it.
1|But, but, they are private sector experts.
0|Or just cut the shit and end the war on drugs.
0|Government small enough to fit in my uterus!
1|Idk, I didn't read anything about that in the constitution.
1|I'm going to use cell phones, wi-fi, and the Internet, to assert that science-believers don't know nuthin'!
1|Surviving historical documents are still liberal propaganda
1|Yeah, Obama drew these Satanic Muslim atheist symbols all over the White House to keep God out.
1|I can't remember, is he a Muslim, an atheist, or does he hang out with radical black Christian pastors?
0|Hyperbole much?
0|why not both?
1|At least we have Ben Carson to be the voice of religious reason.
0|Do you seriously think he'd be doing this were he not running for president?
1|If only they stopped the illegals with photo voter id
1|gettaoutofhere with your common sense, everyone knows all Republicans are dumb and useless.

0|It might be working because this is way too distracting.
1|yeah as we know reddit has been donating to Bernie for decades
1|Al who?
1|Wow, nobody could've seen this coming.
1|All we need to know is what Pyramids are really for and if candidate will not hesitate to kill baby Hitler.
1|Yeah, its like he's against Wall Street all of a sudden because he's running for president..
1|Gun owners just love getting lumped in with religious extremists, criminals and mass shooters.
1|TIL people from a particular country are actually a race
1|Checks and balances, brah.
0|Alternative: Work for it, get good breaks.
1|I totally did not see marijuana legalization in Colorado causing problems in the justice system.
0|I'm not necessarily taking this opinion but one could argue that having 80% of the country show up to vote and having more than two choices would be more legitimate than our current system.
1|yeah republicans destroy everything and democrats are making the world great
1|I thought Obama was the first Muslim elected to Congress
1|Don't forget the Mexicans!
0|Welp, Adam Kinzinger essentially endorsed the shooting by saying that.
1|NSA surveillance has thwarted sooo many ISIS acts.
1|Progress in the wrong direction is still progress!
1|Well it's okay because Canada is white people.
0|Yeah, I've definitely noticed that.
0|No it wouldn't the gov of mass is a republican and he gets to appoint a replacement to finish her term
0|TIL that Doctors are Pharmaceutical companies.
0|He ran to the Christians
0|Conservative Super PAC made up of individuals that have undoubtedly paid MANY politicians to give Speeche$... and not even a hill supporter, this is just ludicrous.
0|The best thing they could do to rebrand Strongbow would be to stop putting piss in it.
0|No, because although our parents and grandparents may use facebook, but the majority of them suck at it lol
0|No, what we need to do is END that system where money can literally buy elections, not continue it.
0|Next up: DT calls for return of all Cosby statues.
0|This is so hilarious that I love it.
0|and according to a torrent, according to some gossip
0|I think Bernie is underwhelming, it's his campaign manager Jeff Weaver that's a powerful bulldog
0|It's amazing how a politician can find the reasonable truth when he is not beholden to those who hold the purse strings.
0|Apples to oranges, mate.
0|So?
0|**HIS ENERGY LEVEL IS BEYOND ANYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY COMPREHEND**
0|Kid is probably hog-tied in the back of a windowless van with a bag over his head speeding toward the airfield.

1|But have they been chosen by Kenyan Muslim ISIS sympathizers?
0|"They've been ""attacking Donald trump since like December they are a shadow of what they once were."
1|Yeah yeah ok I'll play nice Don't mind me I'm just a racist fascist
0|I agree.
0|You know he rolls with Killer Mike, don't you?
1|We can't waste an opportunity to politicize bad parenting!
0|It's because the average American is an idiot
0|That's exactly how I feel
1|I'm sure they were just talking about tea and crumpets, right.
0|I don't know what you're confusing me for, when all I did was answer your question.
0|More then who is paying her now
0|So at the convention, they first vote for the candidate that they were obligated to... but since that candidate is not going to win on that first ballot, then that delegate can vote for anyone else starting round 2?
0|He would be waiting in the wings for his name to be called.
1|I think people who choose to live in Lincoln Nebraska lack the imagination to be depressed.
0|They have been here for a while, THEY are just now applying to become citizens to stop Trump
0|"I think you'd find that to be even more biased, depending on who is supplying the ""facts""."
0|pepper spray to the face!
0|Eventually.
0|Are you high right now?
0|"""Los Angeles Times' Rise into Irrelevance."""
1|I'm 99% sure that Bernie lost by over 20 points!
1|Ah yes because Western nations have the labor capacity and supply chains to manufacture all of the iPhones the world consumes!
1|A young brother's got it bad cus he's brown?
0|But she was only SoS for 4 years...
1|Yeah, so many of us were outraged by the BLM abstruction
0|The only dumb comments are from people demanding men wearing women's clothes go into girls locker rooms.
0|Detroit's been voting Democrat for nearly a century.
0|Only rich people are allowed to have those
0|Considering Killer Mike is a *political activist* as well as a rapper, it seems your opinion on him is based on false premise and worth less than a plumber's opinion on movies.
0|I'm sure they did want to, but they have to consider the reality of creating a riot if the ~~Bern-outs~~ **protesters** resist and/or the crowd turns against them.
0|Assuming it's education and not a reeducation camp
0|Because nobody believed in Obama, no sir.
1|Look at all these horrible bigoted racist Trump Supporters!
1|"""It's all his violent rhetoric...."""
0|I thought it was 36 or maybe 36 was the year they slowed down government spending which many blame that recession on.
0|I just came to the comments to see who didn't read the article.
0|Apparently, being his Sec of State doesn't count.
0|"Yeah, i am not certain, even with his claim being defective, that two guys controlling the same order-of-magnitude of funding as THE REST OF THE COUNTRY COMBINED doesn't warrant a ""Mostly false"" and a hell of a lot of our attention."
0|all while fossil fuel companies continue to bring in billions and pay negative taxes in some cases
0|"""handwringing"" hilarious."
0|You are also breaking rules 4 and 5.
0|Idk but for some of the most important cases the lower court favored the conservatives.
0|I could always use the very anti gun study that found 70k DGUs s year, despite their best efforts.
0|Source is Sanders talking about Clinton's contributions from Wall Street and Fossil Fuels all the time, every day, through out the campaign.
1|Yeah, because saying that you have to treat women like shit doesn't make you a misogynist.
0|Old people brains are low energy.
0|The Lesser Evils
0|Bernie won your state, no?
1|Yes, I'm sure a lot of objective and rational conversation is going to come from you
0|Isn't that what they say about everyone that isn't an ultra-conservative evangelical that agrees with them perfectly on every issue?
0|So the law doesn't matter?
1|This is a game changer
0|Republican in name only
0|Yes
1|So basically three ties.
1|Those people clearly aren't smart enough to understand what is in their best interest
1|I'm sure this is a great moral victory for Bernie that will propel him to beat Hillary
0|Not since the 1920's
0|"If ""conservative"" democrat means ""sane"" Republican I would still take it."
1|Yeah, she made the very conscious decision to migrate here for a better opportunity at age 10.
0|Happy cakeday
0|But if you don't vote, the wrong lizard might get in!
1|No, he's saying he hates women.
0|Shockingly, you are wrong.
0|Never spend it, then beat the game and imagine the ways you could have spent it.
0|Trump Jr.
1|sexist
0|Let them eat clickbait!
0|Oh, is there a nominee?
0|That's why the DNC would not let anyone oppose her.
0|Cut it out!
1|Just remember...President Obama is only nominating someone as a political stunt and has absolutely nothing to do with governing the country.
1|OBAMA STILL IS IN OFFICE HE'S TAKING OUR GUNS AWAY ANYDAY NOW!
0|Cause clearly transportation in the city needs to be more expensive, ffs
0|The pandering is going to be nauseating.
0|Ehh, if government cannot pick winners or losers (much) then (most) corporations and business won't be spending billions of dollars trying to manipulate government.
0|Yeah, because we should send someone to jail for doing nothing wrong because *you don't like her*.
1|yeah he's been so great let's throw all his progress out the door and burn it all down with Trump!
0|The south park episode is so fitting imo
0|How exactly do you plan to attract the fastest-growing demographic group in America when your frontrunner models his pet policy proposal on Operation **Wetback**?
0|yes
1|All hail the Queen.
1|Trump causing violence yet again.
0|Are you actually siding with the citizens united judgement?
0|Yes, many do... because the GOP has been attacking her for decades.
1|"They're only ""activist"" when they do things we don't like."
1|"You don't understand, we call people ""cucks"" because it's hilarious how could you think we're a bunch of hyperaggressive, threatening weirdos?"
1|He's so consistent!
0|But he wanted to.
1|"""He wavered!"""
0|Going to?
0|Yes yes, just like the media ignored Ron Paul because the ReLOVEution was coming... *Facepalm*
1|They are still picking up the pieces in Germany since it was passed, think they are going to default and get kicked out of the EU.
0|"It just annoyed me how pretentious that guy was being saying a ""real job"""
0|You mean like Roe vs Wade?
1|But how would that be exciting?
1|First I've heard of this!
1|Elect him and see!
1|Conspiracy!
1|No, he must be anti-semetic
1|Hillary would never take a big check from the pharmaceutical industry and it certainly would never affect her thoughts on the issue of marijuana legalization.
0|I think Trump is asked about nukes because he's the only candidate crazy enough to use em...literally he said he would consider it
1|Just ask the NSA
0|You realize that this has been tried in other states, like Florida, where they lost money on the deal?
0|I wasn't aware that college had been banned.
0|Yes... I mean otherwise how can you calim he's against women
0|Okay, in the case of the Keystone pipeline (just one example of a concrete policy decision around climate change from the last few years), show me data and informed public debate supporting our policy of disallowing its construction?
0|You make an excellent point.
1|One wants to tax the producers and other great Americans to give communist millennials free stuff, and the other wants to keep rapist mexicans out?
0|Better than nothing
0|But Bernie doesn't do well against SEC teams (states)
0|Watch her move closer to center-right if she gets the nomination.
0|What exactly is unethical about the practice?
1|Yeah, the police and prison budgets aren't set by how many people the can arrest and lockup or anything now
1|And the Republicans will behave any differently with any other Democrat in office.
0|*shudder*
1|"He's a cranky old Jew; this is as ""nice"" as he gets!"
0|Except she already agreed to two debates, one in April and May, based on Sanders accepting a debate in New Hampshire.
0|Notice how no one demanded a recount in Michigan despite the fact that the results were wildly different from what polls suggested.
1|Clinton is a woman therefore anyone that disagrees with her is a misogynist.
0|28 years ago the lobbying group was formed by the brothers however, John hasn't been involved with the company for 20 years.
0|Without border controls, state and local laws are meaningless.
1|But it's Bill, clearly he didn't know what he was doing.
0|Since when has he been moderate?
0|That just isn't true, if anything the fact that Trump is probably going to be the republican nomination without being fully vetted yet thrills the Clinton camp.
0|Ok it's true.
1|"Yes, because what I definitely mean by that is ""individual state primaries""."
0|Are you saying that's not accurate?
0|Death comes to us all .... edited .... my senator will be 90 at the end of the term he seeks
1|I'm sure the Republicans will TOTALLY respect that distinction.

0|Yes they are.
0|-Ignore facts -Repeat self angrily
0|\ CleaverTheDeceiver
0|If it looks like a Democrat is going to win the White House, my guess is the Senate is going to try and race to confirm before the election, and then the Democrats are going to remove his name and put in a more liberal judge.
0|This is why I don't get the theory that she is smart.
1|But imagine how awesome it would be to see Trump and Putin shirtless riding horses together.
1|You forgot your
1|Yes it's a joke.
1|That's exactly how it works
1|Stop being so evil and pay all your taxes!
1|Hillary will offer Sanders the Cuban ambassadorship and all you fuckers will fall in line.
1|She only lost all of those states because they border Vermont
1|They may not vote for her but she will help them just the same
0|Every politician should be as honest
1|Wow, Krugman is such a neoliberal...
1|I thought Hillary was against stand your ground.
0|In Corporate America, stage coach robs you.
0|Well good...she wasn't wrong and shes spineless to go back on it.
1|Careless is just the kind of adjective I want to attribute to a presidential candidate.
0|That'll turn the tide of the race!
0|If that were the case any company could offer slightly more then minimum wage and snag all the best talent from their competitors.
1|He's clearly pandering
1|So you're not a Trump fan?
0|Finally, someone's making sense.
0|\ FEELTHECHAFE
0|I want to believe you're false-flagging, because surely no one could be this childish.
0|*Woosh* sorry
0|Yes that does seem to be what it comes down to
0|"Lollll okkk, the whole ""my generation was great, its this new generation thats the problem"" arguement, never heard that one before"
1|Trump hasn't said anything about the wage gap.
1|no, we're saving jobs!
1|If you don't see that he LITERALLY CALLED CLINTON A WHORE THEN YOU'RE PART OF THE PROBLEM, PIG.
1|You must be lying, Bernie doesn't help downticket dems!
0|I'd say forced anal would be Clinton also.
1|This is so sexist
1|You forgot
1|Everybody knows, charity begins at home.
0|how does it help poor people if the charity pays for Hillarys campaign?
1|Oh please tell me more about how government control of the economy is a good thing.
0|Some Sanders supporters have a very tough time in the grey area.
1|This is functionally equivalent to sucker punching a guy who's actively leaving an event in the face.
0|Compromising your beliefs for a candidate who most of the electorate somewhat agree with is entirely what Democracy is about.
1|No he should get paid the least for doing the shittiest kind of work just because of his age
0|I actually believe women are very able to raise these kids,my mother and father raised me and 2 sisters in absolute poverty,it just takes hard work and responsibility,which you assume should not be necessary for raising kids,which is a recipe for failure.
1|Of course, if you think the Vatican visit was *political* you need a psychiatrist.

1|Nah only the red states
1|I was being very very sarcastic
0|I'm not OP, but I think the point they were making that this is an easily solved problem that is only an issue now because the asshole governor and his goons wanted to sweep it under the rug just to save some money.

1|It's only a lie if you get caught!
0|He lost the popular vote but he got a few more delegates, so technically he won super Tuesday.
1|Yeah and it's not like Trump ever changes his views every three days
1|What a difficult life
1|I think you dropped this.

1|Might happen if they lived in Illinois.
0|Not necessarily, we live in a day and age of 10 second sound clips, both Bernie and Rand can know their stuff but if one of them slips up everyone else's campaign has fodder to fuel their campaigns and defending socialism (even democratic socialism) is a much harder task to present to the American people who've spend the better part of the last century fighting against socialism/communism/fascism.
1|Yeah because single has never been proven to work at all in any part of the world

1|Oh yes, and Hillary fans have been angels who would never take a shot at a Bernie supporter!
1|Your generation is just lazy
1|Because only losers want high voter turnouts.
1|Time wasting losers!
1|You dropped a
0|(insert Olympic-grade mental gymnastics telling you why that's all wrong)
0|We have investigated and found ourselves clean of any wrongdoing
0|I had to go look it up but I think they were talking about how the house decided the election in 1824 (choosing John Quincy Adams over Andrew Jackson even though Jackson got more of the popular vote).
1|New York is just another Deep South state.
0|Tritto.
0|How did he end up becoming the Speaker?
1|It's obviously not used medicinally because it's a schedule I drug still, and those are drugs with no medicinal use.
1|Like African Americans, who have been Bernie's firewall throughout this campaign
1|Yeah so when I heard this suggestion years ago it was her too I bet
1|Way to spin the narrative you DELUSIONAL cult member $Hillary supporter!
1|But what about unifying the party!
0|My guess is that they will stay bc of our roads that their daddy's top tax rate paid for
0|To be fair, they label all US citizens infidels.
1|Incidentally, half the time upon regaining consciousness they will then proceed to impregnate a young, white girl.
1|Ahh, but youre forgetting thats the confederacy and gheir votes shouldnt count because even though they are democrats voting in a primary they are still basically republicans.
1|According to all the conspiracies, a revolt would lead to martial law and then.. i think we either get killed off or something about the anti-christ.
1|Yes, left affiliated media has been so hard on Hillary while giving Bernie a free pass.
0|So we should have non-economists planning out economic policy?
0|Something silly from generations ago about a more special special group, those who read the Torah and Talmud.
1|At least  politics was a bastion of free thought before all this happened
0|There is a difference between criticizing a politician and posting CP on their supporters facebook groups.
1|But I'm poor and I vote, so doesn't that mean all poor people also vote?
1|Yeah, I'm sure they're all over it
1|This is well written and supports its claims.
1|yeah because mexican,muslims and canadians are clearly a race
0|Cause, you know, that woman card has really helped with the last 44 elections.
1|Because Trump is based on policy...
0|I think by the time the general election comes around it will be a lot closer then polls right now indicated for two main reasons, 1) non-incumbent presidential elections are historically close and 2) a large group of republicans will have talked themselves into voting for Trump because they'd legit rather be lit on fire alive then have Clinton win.
1|By all means, let's elect this woman President.
0|Not voting then?
1|Exactly, people have always complained about this, therefore their complaints are invalid.
1|So he only need to do it like 6 more times like you guys made Trump disavow the KKK, because Sanders didn't *really* disavow correctly the first time.
0|im sorta a trump supporter and THIS is a valid criticism of him but its not 'calling for violence' the way the left say or try to justify their violence.
1|Yeah, this really proves it.
1|I'm sure this will turn out to be real
1|Its a vast media conspiracy!
1|well 60% of college grads are girls and the economy is in the poo,!in fact the more it started to equalize the larger the wealth gap became......
1|"Yes, ""accountable people"" are always first to step up in the presence of a political power vacuum...just like Iraq."
0|Hillary wants less debates because when you lie and bullshit, you have to be consistent.
0|"Saying that all Muslims are terrorist or terrorist-sympathizers and must renounce ISIS to prove their moderate-ness is like saying all Christians are pedophiles and the ""moderate"" ones have to denounce those acts."
0|Why can the left never accept that Obama has done a horrible job?
0|Its more the active support part that dissuades the infantry, yes.
1|Only killing babies.
1|Because if a camera crew goes near the Mexican border they're gonna get instantly raped of course
1|Oh well I'll definitely be swayed by Bill because who can you trust more for the truth than the spouse of the person running?
1|You forgot the
1|Well if we let the free market create all of our roads they would be faster, safer, and more comfortable!
1|"""wants to help working families"" Well, then no party better than the Republicans which have passed so many great pieces of legislation that's helped working families over the last 3 decades."
0|I, too, laugh about felonies that I've commited.
1|DELETE THIS!
1|Sorry, I think domestic terrorists trying to bait police into killing their families is similar to global terrorist organization tactics?
0|Your swastika is showing.
0|Probably a Japanese island.
1|Yup let's just keep slapping more bandaids on the problem instead of just fixing it.
0|Only in the SEC.
1|yes, wanting to keep Obamacare in place is basically Republican...
0|"Fox ""news"" Laughably bad."
0|His race is Hispanic, but his skin color and probably ethnicity is white.
1|Because torture totally works.
0|Watching the thread react to that comment was great.
1|Because that worked so well last time.
0|Every time a candidate mentions 9/11 a terrorist gets his virgins.
0|They censored  WhichHillary and  WhichHillaryCensored
1|But but... He was Coooool!
0|I will get so angry if Bernie doesn't win the nomination and people don't show up to vote in the national election.
0|To the Republicans the sanctity of life begins at conception and *ends* at birth.
0|Bad husband, great President and pretty good Serial Rapist!
1|Well, you can wear a dress if you want to...
1|If it is a Republican led committee they will probably congratulate him and ask for contributions for fending off attacks against their guaranteed no price negotiation arrangement via Prescription Plan D. only partially
1|The Republican legislators probably want instructions on how to poison people in their own states.
1|24 to be precise andthis is in comparison to the name recognition of 16 years she enjoyed in 2008.
0|"So much about DNC being ""neutral"" in the primaries."
0|How much is that in pesos?
1|Yep cause America's obviously only for white people.
1|"Said all the crazy ""feminists"""
0|He openly admitted how important money was to influence which played to his position very well (he doesn't need financial help) and people resent financial influence in politics.
1|So you're saying I need to stab Bill to save the whales?
0|This looks like bullshit.
1|Bernie Sanders never dodges questions
1|Right, because we didn't ever have a recession while Glass-Steagal was in place, and it absolutely would have prevented the financial crisis brought about by strictly investment banks.
1|Those white people were just committing mental illness, tho
1|But the headlines in  politics told me he's a racist?
0|Maybe he got laid off.
1|Oh, you go girl.
0|What's that other building next to the White House?
1|For a bimbo.
1|No The Bern is perfect and would never pander for votes!
1|Yes because Hillary supporters have way to much class, just like their candidate.
0|Not for part time workers.
1|No man he's obviously a pedophile!
1|The coin was rigged!
0|You asked for a list of people running for President more qualified than Clinton, I gave you one
1|Who needs government endorsements when you have Killer Mike and Tommy Chong?
1|Just like how a black person lost to her in 2008 because the demographics weren't in his favor.
1|Obviously we need price controls to stop the bad corporations from passing the cost onto the consumer.
0|Same here, I was expecting a really weird looking tie and was dissapointed with the blue polka dots.
0|No, but it's bigger there
1|Then fuck you hippy, get a job!
1|Spoken like a true leader of the people
1|Yeah man he's racist against white people because of reasons!
1|but its only because it a neighboring state of Vermont nothing to see here
0|The Daily Caller is a right wing rag, and its aim in publishing this is to fracture the Democratic Party.
1|TIL Ron Paul controlled the establishment.
0|I'm actually very interested to know who's on Hillary's and Bernie's short lists for their cabinets.
1|Maybe he is using all his corporate and bank donations to fund the wars, to prove he is right.
0|... What does this have to do with politics?
0|I am an 18-34 year old (independent but who cares) Dem here phoning in to say that I overwhelmingly support Bernie Sander.
1|Nah it's cool,the supreme court said it isn't bribery unless it's direct quid pro quo Because apparently that's the only way to get corruption
0|I like to think if Hillary won NH you would be making some excuse about why Nate is wrong.
1|Can someone translate?
1|Shut up, she's a Republican, Republicans are always wrong.
1|But more tight immigration policies are racist bro!
1|That's okay, I'm a paid shill
0|ONLY 50 switched.. 211 still voted for Hillary.
0|Ah i didnt realize that super delegates are all elected officials
0|"""sow your seed!"""
0|It's easy to say in hindsight that he could have prevented 9/11 but it's impossible to say that it 100% could have been.
1|Yeah, Bush had such a tough time getting Chief Justice Roberts approved...
1|You know those buried, disposed chemical munitions that were left over from the Iran-Iraq War totally counts.
1|Holy crap are we *still* taking about this?
0|Only for idiots.
1|You dropped this:
0|"except at least 3 emails contained things that were ""above top secret"" and could only have gotton there via USB stick, since they are files you normally have to be present at the pentagon to even look at."
1|She's going rogue guys.
1|Forgot your
1|But how will this cure racism?
1|But they aren't counting the economic boom that would result and fix that!
1|The economic growth will surely make up for the trillions of dollars adding to the deficit
1|But that would just be the status quo which is not what Hillary is.
1|"He is like, ""yeah man, but I like it up here"""
1|Even though this nation became a power house due to capitalism... We need a change!
0|Bet he didn't have to ask people to clap after THAT speech
1|"Apparently being ""obsessed with identity politics"" is only endemic to Democrats, as opposed to being a partisan phenomenon."
1|I thought we were just supposed to count all of the women and black people for Clinton.
1|Yeah, because a democratically led executive branch would almost *certainly* indict one from their own party and an ex cabinet member.
1|It rounds up to fit my narrative!
1|I guess I should trust your word over my family's and friends' experiences.
0|Seriously, when was the last time someone other than a democrat or republican was elected president?
1|You seem to be forgetting that we already know beyond a reasonable doubt that Clinton is guilty of horrible, unspeakable crimes.
1|I for one, am truly devastated for it
1|Just Elect him president and he'll be about of your hair soon!
1|"Well, that's ""smart."""
1|Because Republicans are so concerned with deficits when they're in power.
1|Love my state so much
1|Iron Maiden own a private jet and are the 1%.
1|I dropped the
1|What about the other party's front running candidate trump?
0|say what you will about Obama, that was pretty funny.
0|"Super Hint: Bernie himself is a ""progressive"" in Congress."
1|You shouldn't take acid and try to be president at the same time.
1|It works really well in Australia!
1|Some states are 3/5's of a state.
1|Ah, always good to see people are searching for *uncommon* ground.
1|You just have to give the tax cuts time to work.
1|"Dude, he'll just go to every government agency and say ""you're fired"" to those wasteful bureaucrats!"
1|Right because he actually has a chance right?
1|Israel has a right to kill Palestinians and colonize their territory because as we all know Palestinians are responsible for the holocaust.
0|Like how there are drivers license ID numbers and social security numbers you could have a voting number.
1|Then you're wrong.
1|Understood your comment is sarcastic but this will be an argument by many of the candidates after tonight, to which I will laugh because Fox Business is full of bleeding heart liberals.
1|But, but, but Norway has oil.
1|I guess as long as you're not serious it's okay to say you're daughter's figure is attractive.
1|Yea, the will of the people should always be less powerful than the will of the extremely rich subset of those people!
1|Of course... I've always agreed that the way to combat fraud is by eliminating all government funding and punishing everyone including the innocent rather than prosecuting those who commit crime.
1|You antisemite...
1|Because a crowded concert hall wouldn't have been a gun-free zone in the first place.....
1|No, I mean, it's not like I've lived here all my life and have it in my username for any reason or anything.
0|Are dancing horses considered valid therapy under RomneyCare?
1|Hey you are taking her out of context you sexist!
1|Well I'm glad every one on reddit is as intelligent as you are.
1|She was just rounding it off to a nice even number
1|Men are vicious and dangerous creatures who should not be tolerated.
1|These are the types of decisions better left to uneducated religious fundamentalits who run the local school boards.
1|But if people disagree with me politically, doesn't that make it a circlejerk?
0|Please be specific
1|Yup, invading Iraq sure stabilized the region.
1|Yeah Trump really needs the cash from me
1|Sanders has the momentum!
0|Surrrrrrrre you're not.
1|But didn't you hear a rapper supports Bernie now so he has the black vote locked up because all blacks vote as one giant group.
1|Looking forward to the hit piece Washington post is going to release about her on this.
0|National poll != electoral map
1|Yes, the whistleblower is clearly the one at fault in this whole scenario
0|Well, we all know she's not going to take the fall for any of it.
1|Oh totally
1|"Yes, he's brought nothing ""new"" to the table."
0|A calculated risk to appeal to the broadest array of voters.
1|No by all means let's just let criminals stay here forever and welcome more in!
1|That would be racist.
0|If she had emails to delete, they were technically in her possession at some point
1|Clearly he meant something horrifically racist that just curdles the blood of anyone who actually hears it.
1|Just like the gays
1|yes deleting emails to avoid FOIA requests such a nothingburger
1|Obama should step down, that way we can get someone impartial to run this investigation!
1|I am sure this will get PLENTY of coverage... the whole country will be talking about it tomorrow!
0|We all are
1|mario's just a greedy prick.
1|"So its being reported by ""Info Wars"" so you know it must be true."
1|Welcome to the harsh uncaring reality of deified free market economics more like, because obviously if unfettered capitalism isn't the answer...there isn't one.
1|Yep because fuck all of the States that haven't voted yet...
0|Hillary's mountain of money from the NRA.
1|Yeah, it's really racist when poor whites are called out for voting against their interests when they vote republican.
1|That right-wing conspiracy driven by Obama's FBI.
1|but Nate Silver underestimated Trump, so clearly nothing he says can ever be trusted again.
0|Till everyone realized he was a cooky unelectable bag of cats in a suit.
1|Good to see that young progressives have decided to help Rush Limbaugh achieve his lifelong goal.
1|Your conspiracy theory is much more plausible than a simple and quantifiable fact like Americans not viewing socialism favorably.
1|Make America Great Again (for those that can afford it)
0|Hillary/Piper Chapman '16 (saw this earlier on reddit)
1|^ Hillary supporters will think you're serious, you should add
1|Yes, Hillary is so good
1|dude you can't be racist to white people EVERYONE knows that
1|Where are the people fighting for equality for women?
1|If only there was an example of a democracy that would function without inherited gun laws for us to compare, right?

0|it wasn't an accident this is the result the GOP wanted
0|How is this politics?
0|So you think Sanders will win roughly 60% of th remaining pledged delegates?
0|I thought this was the Republican credo?
0|I see no problem with anyone saying nigger.
0|I think that is called tunnel vision.
1|I'm sure that Cruz appreciates the 5 supporters that he will gain from this substantial, ringing endorsement.
1|Thankfully, no.
0|Sounds like broccoli.
0|Lol, really?
1|But it's not *exactly* the same.
1|They don't know they're voting against their own interests
0|It's the most profitable mess in millennia.
0|Yeah, if campaign contributions were representative of how people would be voting, Bernie would win in a landslide.
0|Other countries have rural and urban areas and they seem to do fine with a national minimum wage.
0|That is true but they do want to become American Citizens, which is why they are aspiring Americans

0|Bernie to Wall Streeter Please pay your taxes and follow the federal regulations and I agree
0|Desperate for traffic I suppose

0|You know, this might explain why he keeps getting audited.
0|Bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off for him
0|Can reject, count me for rational Trump secondary Bernie primary voters.
1|Yup that's it.
0|Interesting, because Sanders himself uses this exact same logic on Clinton with regard to Wall Street and similar interests.
0|and Immigration as well honestly.
0|She won't do it.
0|This is one of those things where I don't know enough to have an intellectual argument and I assume you don't either so I'm gonna keep trusting the consensus of the economic community
1|We need more voter suppression to keep the old guard in power so they can continue to watch over their own special interests...
1|Yeah I mean if people don't like what a party is about you'd think they'd leave or something and go to one that aligns with their views better.

0|So no one was attested for fighting with non cops?
0|"It's probably more of a ""I believe the prison and pharmaceutical people who gave me all that money"" move."

0|What did he say that was racist and how did you call him out on it?
0|Trump probably was hoping someone would shoot everyone... Dont worry he'll cover the legal fees.
1|Yea, it's not like he entertains the endorsement of the KKK or calls for torture and war crimes or banning an entire religion from entering the US or anything.

0|which is minuscule when you consider the extra services it will aim to provide.
0|I'd care but be less likely to learn about how bad it is
0|Well if he actually does that just maybe.. haha no who I am kidding he'd be a terrible president..
1|Because all the men were busy scooping the driveway?
1|Yeah it's John Kerry all over again
1|This is hard hitting journalism at it's finest
0|He expected everyone to let him win...By the end of it, he was bleeding cash but needed to stay on because there was no way they wanted Trump, Rubio or Cruz...
1|Yeah, those peaceful Trump supporters sure were asking for it
0|why is it that suddenly the rhetoric on reddit is shifting to voting hillary after she spends $1 million on social media?
1|They forgot the

0|At least they get to learn what all the Ron Paul supporters realized in 2012.
1|you forgot the

1|Terrorist*
0|Absolutely pathetic pandering coming from Rand Paul.
0|2 full terms, 6.3 years of which spent cracking up at their own jokes.
0|Oh, derp, I should've remembered that
0|He would be pretty boring in Canada.
0|Sanders' chances are really not that much better, honestly.
1|Also the rest of the states.
1|Rand Paul hasn't been saying this for more than a year now.
0|I see, ya wanna knock her down before she has to eat dirt, anyway :)
0|Resign please.
0|So we are ignoring the 1968, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 2008 Democratic conventions, all of which were nearly brokered conventions?
1|Mental healthcare is for fagets
0|Can't have Wall Street getting regulated, they might cancel their Bloomberg Terminal subscriptions.
1|The fair thing would be to allow Hillary's SuperPacs to pay money to put her articles at the top of reddit.
0|Understood but if you got in an accident or became seriously ill you'd not only be unhealthy but also virtually bankrupt if you're middle/lower class.
1|You forgot the
1|I'm so surprised that there's no mention on  politics of how the same poll shows Hillary increasing her national lead over Sanders from 19 points in December to 25 now.
0|what're we at, 2?
0|It's just in America all corporations want to fuck the people over however they can.
0|Knowing Salon it was probably just a couple of hours ago.
0|As someone said of the Confederacy ....It died of a theory.
1|Also neither one of them was actually an American!
1|OPs mom's vag is cleaner than ethanol.
1|Yeah, because if Roosevelt could do it then Bloomberg definitely could.
1|Yep he did , because as you know the world is strictly black and white and one result counts for ALL results.
1|Cause everyone knows American made cars are so safe.
1|I tok have trouble seeing someone who has been on top of the Republican polls for the last several months beating a pro-immigration, anti-gun Independent.
0|If it's either global nuclear annihilation, or he has to admit it's a toupee.
1|Yeah, that last NRA riot was frikkin' horrible all the burned police cars and broken windows.

0|Tomato tomato
0|TL;DR : First Past The Post sucks.
1|Jesus, might as well kill puppies while you're at it
1|I up voted, but you might mean me.
1|no influence on hillary at all right guys?
1|Words defeat numbers: Sanders is not electable even though he polls better than Clinton every single time.
1|But will he lead us into the wars were already in as well?
1|Found the racist.
1|Yeah democrats totally feed corporate interests more than republicans
1|Yea, there's no enemy if there's no one left there to be your enemy.
0|bush is back but did carson just say screw it and leave
1|Stop this very artful smear
0|The beatings will continue until morale improves.
1|You can't handle the truth!
1|I just **knew** he was weak on foreign policy.
1|Yeaaah... That's gonna hurt Sanders...
1|I'm sure he would be the majority of the black vote as well
1|What could possibly go wrong?
1|Well that wasn't racist at all
1|Who knew that exorcism wasn't an effective way to eliminate the state's deficit?
0|Guess he couldn't afford a laid speech from Hillary
0|We already lost Scalia today, there is no need to lose Judge Napolitano also.
1|because the same tax rate on someone who makes 30,000 a year and someone who makes 3B a year is completely fair!
1|Yeah because turnout was so much higher in 2014 than in 2012.
1|I'm so sad that I decided to play video games instead of watching this mess.
1|Yeah,how dare that black guy voted in
1|I don't know what you're talking about, Roe v. Wade, for example, settled the debate on abortion and didn't at all galvanize the conservative-religious voting bloc into action, electing republicans to four of the next five presidencies when the democrats had made huge strides for the past five presidencies.
1|This will surely bolster his failing Presidential bid...
0|You see everybody, that's what the internet does, the 40 character long copypasta, exactly what the meme-makers gave him.
1|but I thought he was entitled to a lot of votes cause Clinton?
1|Ah, well in that case, carry on then!
1|Because the banks have all the money, so if you break them up then everyone will be rich!
1|Yeah, he probably got to be an incredibly successful property developer by shitting on everyone.
0|hey
1|She's a snake, but by gosh darn, she's a *realistic* snake!
0|Wow, if this is true, what a low move.
1|You forgot the
1|You know, this kind of courteousness is not needed in this sub
1|Yeah, it would be bizarre if a state with a giant population had a representative influence on national politics.
1|But... but reddit is just a circlejerk, no one really likes this guy, right?
1|I'm sure he's just warning the good people of Nevada about the Judo-Bolshevik conspiracy.
1|Yeah but in Nevada they had it on a Saturday morning like damn that's my only day to sleep in
0|This is one of the most obnoxiously biased editorials I've read
0|:( but I have two Haitian brothers, one who served in the Army and can vote this year!
1|By admitting that racism is still alive
1|yea its not like he has to actually have in plans or know politics right?

0|Patrick star: Is money a demographic?
1|There's a shocker.
1|I'm sure she just a Berniebro in disguise.
0|"To add to this, I would think that having an approval rate that high in your own state is a pretty good indicator that you're actually doing a good job, and not something to be ignored because ""Well obviously"" which seems to be the trend when talking about bernie/vermont."

1|And Wikipedia is a viable source in professional life.
1|I wonder why.....
1|A vote for trump is a vote for greatness!
1|Yeah, I'm sure Goldman made a HUGE deal with her if she just agreed to hire this middle manager nobody to do some inconsequential non-policy job on her campaign.
0|Or any military contractor
1|Well Nader did help us get eight years of W. So he has a great record to boast of.
1|But He's an old white man!

1|Lol I'm friends with an ISIS General, I feel disenfranchised
1|Yea, I mistakenly fabricate memories all the time- it shows I'm fit to be President of the United States of America.
1|But Republicans want terrorists to buy guns!
0|FTFY: Unlike Congress, Hawaii Takes Action On Gun Control New laws make Hawaii the first state to enroll **lawful** gun owners in a federal database.
1|Its not, but she's rich and powerful, guess we all better call it a day and drink thier cool-aid.
1|Nah man.. the voting machines were hacked.
1|Get out and vote!
1|But WAR helps the economy...
1|Blah blah something something, trump is worse...
0|But Supremacy Clause states federal law trumps state I thought?

1|Yeah, its totally the work of the Illuminati !
0|Crime is skyrocketing due to geopolitical instability and an influx of refugees, but sure, let's pretend it's their social democratic policies that are to blame.
1|May want to add and
0|I will look into it.
1|What about the political revolution for the democrats?
1|Those are different because people should be allowed to donate as much as they want when it's to the right candidate
0|As a Texan, I disagree.
0|Yeah, I figured as much
1|Yes, because this time it's different!
1|Yeah, who cares about red state democrats, their voices or concerns don't matter!
1|... and no one has *ever* managed to get out of one of those!
1|No it's gotta be a conspiracy
0|Some say it's YUUGGEE (and possibly pink)
1|Yeah, the mainstream media always has a positive opinion of Trump.
0|Most people thought he already did.
0|The inspector general of the state department stated pretty much the opposite of this, and I think he might be better informed than you.
1|Oh well that's settled then.
1|Thanks, World Socialist Website, for your unbiased analysis.
0|One came out just a day before at Clinton +11, the one you referenced was only landlines, so it's probably not quite that drastic.
0|"Just like those ""pesky emails"" how about we just wipe them with a cloth."
0|When you tax income twice, Don't be surprised when it doesn't come back.
1|Something something, only Russian media is state-sponsored!
0|Trump Train woo woooo!
0|Hilary Underwood 2016
0|Is this even actually possible?
0|Just when you think this guy couldn't be more of an asshole.
0|What a weirdly Buzzfeedesque article from NPR.
0|I would love to see trump rip her apart in a debate Jeb2.0
0|I know i can, it's you i wonder about, especially with that username
0|It would make black market guns more profitable.
0|She could always release a few copies of the speeches she gave, it would certainly correct the record.
0|Oh, and I am.
0|Compared to any other time he talks?
0|Islam isn't a race so how can it be racist?
0|So, let's change it.
0|Actually, the House and Senate is looking pretty good for the Blue Team, thanks mostly to Drumpf and his gaggle of embarrassing idiot followers.
0|It's 17 year old that would be 18 to vote during the general election.
0|Isn't that interesting since O'Malley was claiming to be to the left of Sanders.
1|Yeah, get those greedy Jews like Bernanke away from mah Money supply!
0|The point is that if a trump supporter does something he is called out as a trump supporter and Trump is blamed.
1|Oh right, because every illegal immigrant will suddenly go take drivers ed and get a license because they are available.
0|If that's true then there is nothing to worry about.
0|Maybe we shouldn't, but six-digit job losses when the entire industry shuts down are not going to be an easy thing to spin as positive.
0|I am dangerous.
0|So he should rent an apartment for 8 years?
0|Indeed.
0|he did say the notion that humans cause weather ridiculous which is funny because that is demonstrably true and you would have to have never run one search on it.
1|I don't know, that army blimp program is pretty sweet
1|Don't worry, if Hillary is president she'll put a stop to this
0|Meh no one expected him to come close in Michigan, if there's one thing weve learned this election season its that literally anything can happen
0|In 8 to 12 years, the oligarchs will have solidified their control and democracy will truely be a sham show.
0|KKK tainting Trump's name: TRUMP IS RACIST LITERALLY HITLER Sanders supporters tainting Sander's name: It's not Bernie himself, chill guys.
0|But but I'm educated, not white, not christian, and under 50 :(
0|Why not neither.
0|And that is something I disagree with Sanders on.
0|Oh no no no friend, he's a *democratic* fascist.
0|Not according to the coroner's report
1|Only the living can be victims, the former victims are now simply called casualties, and they don't matter.
0|public office =/= media coverage
1|yes, because this nut represents all of us and we all condone his actions.
0|I live in a swing state and I will not vote for Clinton.
0|She's got my vote in that race
0|Because reality rarely coincides with what they want so very badly to believe.
0|Hugs and free money
0|The Democrats are happy to help trump to become the Republican candidate...
0|"You just proved my point that ""Muslim"" is not code for ""Arab."""
0|Well it's not just his roommate, it's like his current co-workers in US Senate who share the same letter next to their name, that also don't like him.
0|I cannot begin to describe the amount of information he does not source, at least on the radio.
0|Don't they have a right to defend themselves if they get invaded by a neighboring country or terrorist group?
1|Cheap gas is a short-term benefit when we have all those environmental clean-up careers on the horizon.
0|someone should explain his pro life position to him
1|Yes the USA deserves a closet communist.
1| Let's protest reason and logic @ a Bernie rally!
0|Just wait- he has to finish fighting his own party before he starts on the Hilldawg
1|I hear the work he's done with the VA is superb....
1|Well I guess that we have settled on the fact that using violence to achieve political ends is apparently now acceptable, and we just need to work out the details.
0|I don't really care if he's honest, because I think he's a lunatic, so it's a moot point.
0|Lol.
0|That's even more frightening.
0|She did not use her .gov email address very often, we know that for sure..
0|"My experience with  the_donald: ""Stfu loser"" ""You fucking fucking commie cuck"" ""I'm offended because you took the lords name in vain you fucking faggot"" Don't forget; lots and lots of capital letters."
0|it wasn't.
0|Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
0|If they secede, I vote we build Trumps wall around Texas.
0|I haven't heard her campaigning on that point.
1|Maybe it's time to rise up against the corporate tool Elizabeth.
0|But we can still get front page posts about Killer Mike?
0|I bet Jimmy McGill is behind this.
0|"I don't even play civilization and I get it... ""-1 lol amiright?"""
0|What is a witch in D&amp;D
0|Jeeze... we need to get the Fayetteville Police Department looking through Hillary's e-mails when they are done.
1|I'm so glad they're gone now, thanks anonymous!
0|But but but, it's all an artful conspiracy by the Republicans!
0|You know how drastically the world has changed since FDR?
1|Of course he feels this way, he's just glad he's alive
1|Very up to date and it's being told by the 1st hand source!
1|Oh yes because they're stopped now.
0|What the actual fuck
0|I'm pretty sure East and West Germany were separate countries, and that the Iron Curtain also existed to prevent illegal immigration to and from East Germany.
0|How can you tell her politics when they have constantly changed?
0|if bernie throws his support behind clinton he will throw away all the things he stands for to do so.. in my mind thats counter to what he has campaigned for
0|Bernie should drop out.
0|The only people who think that are people who haven't researched him.
0|Not sure about this stat
0|I don't know, looking through your post history you don't strike me as someone that would be able to make that kind of decision.
1|And you can't spell TRIUMPH without TRUMP!
1|Yeah... Democrats will totally win.
1|Those bodies on the beaches of Normandy dont count silly
0|Kudos again, sir or madam!
1|Wait, I thought he was racist
1|Moral victories
0|It's amazing how oversimplified this is.
0|Superdelegates are undemocratic... unless they're supporting Bernie Sanders
1|What if she's lying about that too?
0|Holy Berniejerk, Batman!
0|His approval among democrats is even higher.
0|Can we just get a god damn libertarian in office because it just seems both parties are for war now.
1|And he is jewish, I bet he does the taxes!
0|That's the same thinking that got us into this mess.
0|Then let's throw them out and get more progressives in office!
0|It's pretty hot
1|And Trumps gonna win Cali in the GE
1|"Um no I believe she's ""a progressive who likes to get things done."""
0|That's like going to the store for chocolate ice cream, finding out they don't have any, and getting grilled salmon instead.
0|You're dreaming
1|wow your comment isn't oozing with thinly veiled racism.
1|Because it was 100% their fault
0|I could have told you that.
1|Compelling argument, I'm now convinced Trump is racist and literally Hilter.
1|Yea, uh, there were no other factors to him losing.
0|Plenty of sick have to travel similar distances to hospitals, some have to fly across country to receive treatment.
0|They might campaign on taking action but once they were in a position to do so they wouldn't do anything about it.
0|What's funny is you change Hilary to trump, and GOP to DNC, and that's a perfect view of my side of the aisle.
1|Oh no, a democrat supports the only stable liberal democracy in the Middle East, even if they elected shitty hawkish leaders.
0|He goes by King Rafael, now.
1|I was thanking him for trying
1|I'm sure they wouldn't mind you using them to make your point either.
1|was the phone call longer than 10 seconds
1|But but but....he's the smartest and the best businessman....all his ideas are the best.
1|It's like Clinton is a special interest to the rest of the dnc establishment....but no one should expect that the dnc establiment would be swayed by Hilary's funding channels.
0|"tagged as ""triggered whenever a cultural Leninist word is re-appropriated"""
0|And if the Republican race was settled, they would play spoiler as well, hence I have no problem with closed primaries.
0|Ask the Jews
0|And 8 months ago, when they needed to register, they didn't even want to vote at all.
1|Because here in jersey my governor is allowed to tell me how I can and can't hurt my body but fill his with artery clogging cheese burgers!
0|Yeah, they should have just talked ill about her behind her back and online, like normal people.
0|No its some kind of weird hypothetical with a dubious, poorly articulated point.
0|Does Elizabeth Sweden's age make her a less-attractive candidate?
0|can someone ELI5 why provisional ballots may not be counted?
0|Can confirm, I saw the daily beer trucks every day I was there.
1|Yeah it's only half a million people or more, no biggie.
0|Or just write in Bernie rather than go with Jill.
0|Give us the option to vote online!
0|If true, trump was complicit
0|You can always expect  politics to shitpost these articles time and time again without ever knowing the definitions and/or differences of these ideologies.
0|No one said the revolution would be easy ... I'm under no illusion of the odds, but I'd still like to go down fighting than let the progressive momentum be stopped by a Trump candidacy that will likely dominate the message
1|I for one am glad to see that people can think in nuance without jumping to absurd polarized conclusions that can easily be manipulated.
0|I can't believe I'm saying it, but Mitt seems so *sane* and reasonable when he's compared to the clowns and nut jobs currently leading the GOP pack.
0|It's not about being optimistic or not, just simply being fully prepared for any and all circumstances no matter what and accommodating each and every vote efficiently.
0|I'm still convinced that show was set in the Metroplex.
0|Seconded
0|I don't know if you're new here or not, but bernie is a person who exists.
0|and why is that?
0|If they do it anyway, enjoy President Trump or Cruz.
1|It's okay, she said she just wiped it with a cloth.
0|Yea, it's not like this guy tried to make a sound argument or something.
0|Same is true of Clinton on the Dem side.
0|Her strategy is going to work because if there's one thing Americans love it's cowardly weak person who whines and runs from the problem.
1|No they will miss Cruz to much.
0|"Oh but actually profits are at record highs, in fact newly merging corporations frequently brag to investors about how they expect to retain all profits from anti-competitive ""synergies"" -- in other words price-setters are confident in their ability to siphon wealth from customers without thought of passing savings, in effect overpricing themselves when customers have little choice but to waste their hard earned pay."
0|i can't tell if you're joking
0|That or they haven't been paying attention to the Republican race
1|Obama probably won't do any such thing until he changes his tone
1|And a debate with Bernie and peace talks are essentially the same thing.
1|the first female president
0|He tried to get veterans kicked off fifth avenue.
1|Donald Trump finally takes the Conservative vision for abortion to its logical conclusion and all the other cuckservitives that are cucks for Obama are saying they don't want punishment in the event they broke a law.
0|Oh yea I getcha, it's really just low effort posting haha
1|Hey he was asking for it dressed like that
0|It is, but you don't have to travel to Delaware to get Dogfishhead.
1|Why is this reminding me so much of House of Cards... oh wait...
1|No, because she's a Democrat
0|Which is unconstitutional.
0|seeing as how our taxes go into both the DNC and the RNC, they shouldn't be considered private at all.
0|This whole Cruz/Trump thing is for some reason reminding me of that Will Ferrell movie The Campaign.
1|You said shes well spoken thats racist!
1|Yeah, it's all a vast, left-wing conspiracy...
0|Someone's check cleared.
1|Well to be fair, he had to get something, since Kenya doesn't vote on US elections.
0|I'm terrified of a Hillary future more than anything, so the best way to vote against her is to vote Trump.
1|It was also nice how they had two little tiny speakers for a hall of 6,000 people so you literally couldn't hear a goddamned thing anyone was saying the first half of the day
0|He'll wind up undercover for the DEA or ATF.
1|Nah, way too much work.
0|What's the different between 'public corruption' and 'private corruption?'
1|Nop... Pie in the sky... No we can't!
1|TRIGGERED
1|Yeah state government should be the ones to restrict your freedom instead of the federal government
1|An art degree.
0|And yet people are still gonna be stupid enough to vote for her
1|Atleast Chelsea Clinton stays on message
0|So there's pretty much 100% chance he'll lose?
0|And the corruption is easier to hide.
1|Yahoo is so rightwing these days.
0|Okay.
1|Man she's just like a regular new yorker, I guess I was wrong about support sanders.
0|How did the Panama trade deal facilitate hiding money?
1|I'm sure this will play great in NY
1|Maybe she really is prepared to take on the financial industry in earnest and the only things she's hiding in her paid speech transcripts are racist jokes.
1|And I'm sure 13-year-old you worked very hard to earn the money you invested.
1|A year of campaigning just isn't enough.
1|Dont worry I am sure the corporate news will show the story
0|I can't believe a sitting democrat took foreign policy advice from George Bush and needle Dick Cheney.
0|"Not even a ""No I'm not taking fracking money"" ?"
1|B-but she dabbed on Ellen!
1|When have they ever done such a terrible thing?
1|He uses a bidet of course, just like the Europeans he wants wants to emulate.
1|Better dead than red.
0|Corporate bias, like any other outlet that accepts money for advertising.
0|Bernie don't have no SuperPAC.
0|Parliamentary system works a bit differently
0|Except she also belongs to one of the most powerful political families, if not the most powerful.
0|In a few more generations, the only people affected will be the ones who need to eat.
1|Well, he did want to finish his sentences rather than let Hillary interrupt everything he said so clearly he's a sexist
0|Charities are actually quite inefficient.
0|Random Rubio is beginning to reach Unexpected Cena levels
0|"""I need a photo op too!"""
1|How much do you think the Vatican is paying him for this?
0|What the fuck did you just call me?
1|Obviously his donation to mother Russia.
1|The dude's trying to stop a woman from becoming president, of course he's sexist!
0|Yes.
0|I mean if that happened, hoo boy break out the popcorn
1|I left off
0|HAHAHA (cackle cackle)
1|To quote myself: This is functionally equivalent to sucker punching a guy who's actively leaving an event in the face.
1|"Don't you know she's gonna break down all those ""barriers"""
0|Idk, you're voting for Clinton you're obviously pretty dumb.
0|Not on Facebook and I hate memes.
1|She will be trustworthy only if the Republicans do it too.
1|Yes but also the only true liberal.
0|Ugh is this what reddit is gonna be on Wednesday
0|You start a riot obviously :)
1|No worries, it was just an accident.
0|Well I'm a sanders supporter and I don't have an issue with it so you're wrong.
1|Based on their coverage of the race so far I'm certain NPR will find that Sanders has a valid case, and the Clinton campaign crossed a legal line.
1|So they did change them at the last minute!
0|By this time in 2008, I'm pretty sure we knew Obama was the candidate.
1|Good thing he went to the Vatican!
0|If you read some of the stories told about her then the tough as nails photos seem to suit her.
1|Yes it's so shocking how Ben Carson didn't get the nom
1|so then they vote again right?
1|Because John Oliver has the right views, duh!
1|America is, after all, a Christian nation.
1|If he says it too many times it becomes a joke and we don't have to do anything about it.
0|I'm being serious, where do I apply?
1|No it's Trumps fault, Chicago was a peaceful cornucopia of cultures before he held his hate rally there.
1|We'll need a shell company to launder our Kickstarter funds.
1|The question is, should Bernie apologize?
1|Clearly she should get off the government tit, and get a fucking job.
0|Upvoting it to finally see how Sanders folks think when his candidacy faces a small amount of opposition in comparison to what other candidates face on a daily basis.
0|Uh huh, so what you're saying is you don't think he could have made it as an independent?
1|You are obviously just a low info voter...
0|for providing healthcare and education to his people...
0|She has been in White House for 3 of the last 6 terms so she's pretty close.
0|Yea I also want a source on this
0|Just the Left?
0|I am not a witch!
1|let me think how did it go for the last blue eyed blond hair person to blame there problems on a Jewish person
1|Thank you MADD
0|absolutely yes
0|i do think it will be rigged, still will be entertaining to watch though.
1|Yup cuz I've never heard the term Shillary used by bernie crowd.
0|It's both
1|"Right, just like the roads or everything else the ""inept"" gov has done."
0|"Are you opposed to every instance of ""other people paying your way""?"
0|All of them.
0|They should probably just start allowing people who have CHLs to bring their guns on planes anyway
1|Yeah the debate he had with those blm protesters is why I'll be voting for him
0|Often, the ability to cash a check is the first step to *obtaining* that bike or POS car.
1|if you got enough money to join an elite group like frats and sororities you shouldn't have to worry about getting in trouble for underage drinking and sexual assault right?
1|How dare you attack a fine American patriot like that?
1|They're not troops anymore, so fuck 'em
1|Our Republicans are such wholesome patriots abusing their own President is more important than working to improve their own nation.
1|Because that's never happened before.
0|is it Shit Post Monday again?
1|Wow you are so smart and wise I am now socialist thank you sir
1|How can you laugh when our sailors were held by those iranian scumbags for almost 20 hours?
0|In a two party system, how true is that?
1|Yea, lets just keep marching to hell then, seems a much smarter idea
1|Obviously because they're just good 'ole Christians!
0|One thing for sure, it won't come to pass if she becomes president.
0|Report them to the FEC so our lord and savior Ol Cotton Candy Hair can run unopposed.
1|"Well I think Donald Trump's ""I'm a winner and you're all fucking losers"" attitude will restore the Republican leadership back to sanity"
1|the war was just a meme
1|Yeah but socialist comminism is bad!
1|"You mean you don't enjoy answering ""carpet bomb and kill our enemies"" for every foreign policy question?"
1|His reputation will always be tarnished for picking the Tar Heels in 2012.
0|They should start posting these before the debate...
1|psssshhhh who in this sub actually reads the articles
0|And China's job was made so much easier by the NSA when they inserted backdoors in everything they possibly could.
0|Just as an alien invasion would unite the world.
1|I, for one, welcome our new Koch overlords.
1|So amazingly well.
1|*_I think he should seek a declaratory judgment._*
1|And the swing voters will come around in droves.
1|She's just that smart.
0|ask yourself why the people in power would continue this bullshit unless it benefited them in some way....
1|Exactly - because there are so few payers, we need more welfare.
1|No wonder trump never mentions any polls
0|if you're anything like me, the military killed my knees and my hustle with it.
0|I don't recall you being against genocide.
0|Yeah, I really want to vote for a candidate who deeply resents the truth.
0|I didn't count even 5 in that article... must have missed something...
1|Bernie might be able to solve this problem by taxing the 1%.
0|"Prob the best way I've seen someone say ""If you don't vote for Sanders you are stupid"" on Reddit"
0|It's not a death sentence, but it is a bad news, considering that Nevada was one of the states where Bernie was expected to have a relatively good shot at winning.
1|He's openly racist and sexist and insults people, so he can't be part of the establishment!
1|yep, she is only $200k~ in their pocket.
1|"Yeah ""the government should belong to everyone"" what a crazy Marxist idea"
0|Because his economic policy is so bad.
0|Then it's not relevant to the discussion.
1|Yeah because corporate media is totally concerned with keeping the average American informed with what the President is up to.
1|"I think that falls under ""mildly negative"", ""mildly disingenuous"" and ""mildly missleading""."
1|Where's the fun in that?
0|Asking the hard hitting questions.
1|I hope so give them paranoid whities something to really fear.
1|While we're at it, let's also teach men not to rape, educate the world how only white people can be racist, arrest all members of the patriarchy, and create federal safe spaces for women and otherkin.
1|But he'll never be able to negotiate anything with Congress
1|Well, that sounds like a winning general election strategy if I ever heard one
1|Ah yes, that grassroots Clinton campaign.
1|Enjoy your down votes, terrorist!
1|Traitor!
1|"Yeah, I totally imagined all those comments in the numerous pro-Sanders threads calling Hillary a ""bitch"" and a ""cunt"" who ""cackles"" at everything."
1|Nah dude they're just uninformed.
1|I did hear him say that he thought Wal Mart employees should be paid the same as doctors.
1|Well obviously you're a filthy commie
0|So much for the discussion culture.
0|some states have laws that minors minimum wage is different than an adult, but they also come with additional restrictions for the employer such as number of hours, consecutive worked hours with out a break, periods that the minor can work, etc.
0|It's hard to differentiate between joking sarcasm and vicious sarcasm, my bad.
1|Man, how dare Sanders point out the criminal's constant lying......what shameful behavior
1|i was
0|Not on CNN
1|I keep forgetting that Hillary is only really an extension of her man...
1|But Bernie is promising Free stuff
1|Yeah those words were worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, why would anyone want to read them.
1|"But he's not going to carpet bomb *cities*, he's going to carpet bomb ""where ISIS is!"""
1|Well, you sure showed me.
1|So you're saying Bernie wants to raise taxes and cut jobs from hard working Americans?
1|But America is the only good country on earth
1|"Yeah, we'll pay less but that means that poor people might get healthcare ""for free"" Not on my watch!"
0|2,125,551,738th Hillary shill account.
1|Yep definitely no famous or powerful Jews out there.
1|Because the Civil Rights Movement only took place in Alabama
1|...but, nothing to see here, right?
1|Yeah, because all military personnel are good people by default.
0|Right, I'm not disagreeing with you I am building on you point
1|Yeah, good sportsmanship gives you winners.
1|Your contribution is valuable.
1|Don't forget he's a Canadian too!
1|Truly these two are our only hope to fix corruption.
0|Oh, you don't think FDR stacking the court was non-partisan, do you?
1|If we just invade a few more middle eastern countries they will realize how bad Islamic fundamentalism is and embrace democracy.
1|That's the democratic spirit!
1|Ron Paul 2016!
1|Can't be she is a dem
0|Finally a group Bill can really get behind.
0|"but then wouldn't deportation bring massive poverty as US citizens are forced to either limit production or take on jobs that cannot pay ""normal wages""?"
1|Proof that Bernie Sanders is a menace to society.
1|TIL Trump is an Anti-Semite
1|"""Resisting arrest"" - Hillary should pounce on this and show the film in her super-pac ads."
1|You know who also signed a piece of paper promising he wouldn't do something...?
0|Because r politics is a circlejerk
1|Minorities don't know any better.
0|Yea we do for the general thank god.
1|Don't ya know all that money goes to bombs used to blow up innocent children in the desert!
1|Oh, his *kids* will be running it, in that case there's definitely no conflict of interest.
1|"Apparently only the ""black *thinkers*"" not patronizing at all!"
0|May have been autocorrect/predictive text.
1|Probably the super supreme judges of I had to guess
0|Enjoy wasting your time.
0|"I'm not a Hilary supporter but didn't she say black gang members were ""super predators"" not all black people?"
1|Right but while we got you here How Can You Trust Hillary Clinton After the 2008 Campaign?
0|And a side of fruit salad.
1|Don't forget about the scourge of rap music.
0|"""No no, I meant I'm going to take a bat to Planned Parenthood!"""
0|I kill a lot of paper targets
0|And this guy has the support (and growing at that) of the Tea Party - so called lovers of the Constitution.
0|What if he killed the real Ben Carson and stole his identity.
1|So you hate the Jews?
1|This clearly paints a one sided picture in every way, totally not biased at all
1|But some people have jobs and can't bother to give their boss a 2 weeks heads up that they won't be able to work Saturday to vote in their parties election
1|This is just more proof that she's more electable
0|Bernie will make a great Secretary of Labor in Hillary Clinton's cabinet.
1|Well...he *is* Jewish.
1|Yes, they're going to force us to convert and they will also make us get gay married!
1|Yes because all those old dogs have such a wonderful record of being right about Trump this election season.
0|Whatever floats your boat amigo.
1|so is this a problem?
1|Jeb can fix it!
1|Oh great, more liberals controlling the minds of our youth
0|*Pastor.
0|Sooo, you're saying he's worse than a mechanic then!
1|Well your obviously lying.
1|Yeah, because its value is stable
0|Make sure you spit on your local unionized mailman today.
1|"Well I guess we could let them die in the street instead, since we're a ""Christian"" nation and all."
1|Next they will be telling us that is a photo of Charles Koch the great individual rights humanitarian as he, Koch so recently went on television to claim.
1|You're right, Obama loved the 5,000 troops he sent to Afghanistan and totally fixed the VA for them
0|You need Jesus.
0|By its traditional definition...
0|This is like saying someone who discovered a corrupt cop and burned down the entire police station is a hero because the law shouldn't apply to him.
1|For accurate intel on where the ISIS folks responsible for this are, just ask the Carson campaign: he has better info than the President apparently.
1|Wake up sheeple
1|Nono it's just Bernie!
1|Yeah, because the guy talking about healthcare for everyone is more evil.
1|But they were white
0|I guess my question to you is, why don't you hate it?
0|What Nixon did was Keystone Cops compared to this.
0|As a Diabetic who is paying almost 330 a pay period for both myself and my wife, I would gladly sacrifice lower wait times to save almost 500 a month on health insurance.
1|Just another example of how McCain isn't a 'real' Republican
1|can't wait
1|Lets dump more arms in the middle east that will solve the problem.
1|Create a registry, maybe give them all tattoos so we know who they are and for our safety.
1|Because it's easy for anyone of us citizens to control even our own elected officials let alone the rest of the country's
1|But it's *both*!
1|Well if she doesn't dress like a slut she wouldn't have been raped
1|"Guy gets jumped at a Trump rally for saying Black Lives Matter: ""Well he had it coming"" Masked white guys shoot 5 people at a BLM rally: ""BLM are terrorists"" Round of applause for reddit being consistent."
1|I think he meant the Generation that handed out the first ever massive tax cuts in the time of Multiple Wars while massive de-regulating led to the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression...
1|Goddamn communists, always trying to advertise stuff they're giving away for free!
1|Agreed, but anyone speaking to the contrary is just uneducated and has no idea what they're talking about
0|TIL: Colin Powell was shagging Corina Cretu.. One of the hottest politicians that ever existed
0|I disagree.
0|It's way worse, it seems he actually has children.
0|You know that the DNC + HRC campaign had already successfully dictated the first half of the debate schedule at the lowest viewership times possible--on holiday weekends and during major sports events--right?
0|"""Shocking,"" said no one."
0|What article?
0|You should never ban guns outright
0|And why did he decide to run according to you?
0|Since when does Trump say yuge?
0|I hope this comes up tonight at the Town Hall
0|Yeah, which is why we can't always trust our experience or anecdotes.
0|I feel bad for he guy.
0|""" That dirty rock and roll music. """
1|Oh yeah, cause of course Hillary , and Trump are such a charismatic hotties .
1|All his officials identify as proud black women, I find it offensive that you would assume them to be white men simply because of stereotypes
0|Based on his recent comments, I don't think he'll endorse her if she is nominated, but he also won't run third party and hand the election to the Republican candidate.
0|Tell us how O'Malley can claim to be to the left of Sanders and not be called a socialist?
1|cuz she's the cool black guy now
0|... how do you sexually harass someone without being sexist?
0|"You can't really lay out a detailed plan to ""renegotiate trade deals and better use our leverage"""
1|You're right, I'll start up voting the things o don't care about so this changes
0|Sometimes I feel as if my state is right there with FL.
0|No
0|Blame the Berndroids.
0|Yeah, Trump is best odds to win the nomination in betting markets.
0|And thanks to the internet, people that didn't know - can now read all about it, like the Shah of Iran and his overthrow.
0|Well, they may still have a way of identifying the correct records.
0|Also seeing eye dogs.
0|"I remember back in 5th grade in the back of our social studies textbook, (this was roughly 2005, and the book must have been a few years older than that) there was a ""People to Watch"" thing and Obama was listed there, just a Senator from Illinois at the time."
0|"I understand and it's fine you have your reasons, but saying ""you dumb if you don't vote for Bernie"" is pretty stupid because they are assuming we have the same interests."
1|Islamaphonia and building walls is what strong people do!
0|NC has only 5% more African American population than Michigan did.
0|Well this isn't a great example of the influence that the DNC has with the media seeing as she said that almost 3 weeks ago and nothing has changed.
0|Was there a gag order in place for her college speeches?
0|Get the on the  TrumpTrain!
1|Wow, when I was 8i didn't understand anything about politics.. good for this kid to not be influenced by their parents
0|It's been nipped in the bud, sorry.
0|Well I think that's an assumption.
0|Feinstein is always the greater evil.
1|I think you forgot the
0|Or you know, the name was gradually changed into what it is today, like many scandinavian surnames.
0|When there is a history of protesters being beat up at his rallies it's not something that should be joked about
1|Yeah, where is the National Review of yesterday when Buckley was writing such intellectual articles on the inferiority of the black race.
0|Nope, not this one at least.
0|This definitely deserves to be the top comment.
0|Right I believe that, NDA's are garbage.
1|Whatever... She's a progressive that gets things done
0|And with all of that is still not as scary as Hillary Clinton who has already sent thousands to die through her lack of political caution.
0|My thought as well.
0|Hopefully there's a big party at the 19th hole to celebrate!
0|I'm calling for an end to caucuses and an end to closed primaries both.
0|I'm not sure if I should be scared of the Trump 'supporters' or these groups of Sanders 'supporters' and that's coming from a strong Sanders supporter myself.
0|Or get a job at Starbucks now and go to ASU
0|I miss those bumper stickers the good ol' boys used to put on their trucks.
0|He wants to be free of the consequences that come with breaking laws?
0|It's easy to be confused when you have the American brand of capital L Libertarian, who love capitalism more than they hate the State.
0|Not only Hispanics.
0|Knew you couldn't produce proof :) I called you straight out on your lie, post proof and we can continue.
0|And you just proved my point.
0|"""Right Turn"" is definitely for Hillary, much like Zoolander she can only go left after 3 right turns."
1|Maybe it is PTSD from the time she came under fire ...
0|And yet his supporters have, while Trumps have been pretty peaceful
1|Huge crackdown on white gun owning farmers after that takeover earlier this year.
0|No wonder Arizona has more members of the Congressional Freedom Caucus than any other state.
0|She personally punched Hitler
1|Man, you sound like a commie.
0|Yeah, if you reduce fascism down an absurd amount to fit your narrative.
1|I mean, same thing right?
1|Always remember, the first amendment only applies to stuff you don't dislike.
0|"She knew what was in the skit...she could have shut that down...or told him to ""cut it out"""
0|I wonder how many people think we shouldn't judge all muslims negatively because of a few terrorists and extremists, then judge Trump and all his supporters because of people like this person.
0|Actually, that's what he did with all 3 candidates -because it was a Town Hall and not a debate.
0|That's like a sensationalist way to interpret what he said.
1|As long as they don't have the shoulder thing that goes up I'm fine with them.
0|This is why America can't have nice things.
0|You mean like elections for Vermont senator?
0|Stuffing the ballot boxes, falsifying vote results, killing the opposition, preventing the opposition's ability to campaign, idk
1|No, its selfish of you not to vote for the candidate I want!
0|Pretending like you are older and wiser than everybody else might have worked out better for you if you hadn't put your age in your username...
1|Proud to be a Kentuckian today...
0|So he can get beat for the twentieth time?
0|Be the First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State and you probably will
0|That feeling when Bernie supporters don't even realize they just upvoted something that helps Hillary
0|Yeah I'm sure sooo many women told you that.
1|Because the second most favored candidate amongst black voters is Donald Trump
0|**BUT IN THE END**
0|Even if he wins it won't be by much if the latest polls is showing Hillary is winning by 8 points.
0|Because they're irrational pricks
0|Compared to the world at large dems are at most centrist for the most part.
0|His name is Trump.
0|The inalienable rights are enshrined in the Constitution and our interpretation of it.
1|Our tax dollars going to good use, folks
0|If you were dumb like me you would represent 33% of the vote
0|That actually depends on the bar.
1|But still better than Hillary, right guys?
0|Murtaugh trolling Riggs like an expert
0|So maybe someone should do a drive to fund these people who can't afford an ID so they can legally vote.
0|Sarcasm, right?
0|well, that the mental age of his target group
0|Ron Paul feels his pain...
0|Based on his dismal performance, I'm going to go with no.
1|No one's trying to silence dissent around here.
1|Because using e-mail for something incredibly time-sensitive makes a ton of sense.
1|Nah dude, it's reddit, we're all cool here!
1|It's rappers, most definitely rappers.
1|What does this have to do with Bernie Sanders?
0|The way I see it is, it's like being upset that your dad wasn't cool enough, so you want a teenage father instead.
1|Well maybe that's what he's planning to spend all the donated money for
1|You're right, you can get so much better journalism from TYT, breutbart, infowars, salon and the huffington post.
1|wheres the
0|Surely you don't mean the same general public that thinks the Republican Party is making us an international laughingstock.
0|Those companies do buisiness in our communities protected by police, they transfer goods on our infrastructure, they benefit from our stability provided by our military, all paid for by your tax dollars.
1|Hey their website is getting shut down give em a break
0|Sure, I'll just wait for my parents to give me a small loan of a million dollars.
0|Since there is none under Georgia law, yes?
1|Maybe in addition to the Cleveland police, they can get reenforcements from Chicago, Baltimore and Phoenix ?
0|If a little bit of rhetoric from a presidential candidate in a country on the other side of the world are enough to recruit moderate Muslims for ISIS then I question how peaceful they really were in the first place.
0|Sent as many work emails as personal emails*
1|Good points
0|But he gets rid of the payroll tax, so people making like 40k get like a 2k tax break that the business pay for instead
1|Shhh that doesn't fit the narrative!
0|Shows how much you know about your own candidate.
0|The problem isn't the amount, it's the disparity, especially when you recognize that Wall Street nearly crashed the economy.
0|I think it's more like Now a private company won't be able to perform a completely legal process that I'm paying for because other people don't want me to!
0|Essentially
0|Christ dude that's a bit cold.
0|Because the Supreme Court ruled in DC v. Heller that the announced purpose of the amendment does not limit the scope of the amendment.
1|But it's about momentum
0|Thanks for the info.
0|If they are making a profit, then the employees aren't getting their fair share!
0|Why would you flood the mine?
0|Honestly, Public Health and International Relations on their own aren't known to be difficult subjects
0|Domt forget Tom Cotton.
0|If you want to bring statistics into this then you shouldn't be afraid to bring up the statistics where blacks are insanely over-represented in all forms of crime.
1|Really goes to show you how intolerant, judgmental, and quick to anger white people are.
1|Please tell me that you forgot, or assumed everyone would understand
0|I'll keep that in mind for when your boy, Shaun King, posts some hack article for NYDN.
0|I love how these goalposts keep moving.
0|You have a list, but where are the important and influential ones ?
1|Yeah cuz elections have shown he actually has people that support him
0|66% are right
0|Clearly they're all pre-op.
0|Most Americans are wrong.
0|I'm sure the House Oversight Committee will hold hearings to...oh, wait...he's not expected to run for elected office as a Democrat...nevermind.
1|I'm sure they will treat them with utmost respect and decency that any human being deserves...
0|If you're catholic enough for it to matter you are most likely not voting for *any* pro-choice candidate.
1|Some real stiff competition on his side.
1|Hey man, with the lamestream media so biased we have to look elsewhere for objective news.
0|I dunno, being ahead by a delegate lead that's never been surpassed is pretty telling
0|I'm sure the dude that pays 8000$ for visiting a doctor due to any generic pain will hate the idea of free healthcare for all.
1|Surely the cost of living wont go up?
0|While all politicians make promises they can't keep, Bernie most definitely can't keep his promises unless he dissolves congress and name himself almighty ruler of America.
1|As long as she gets to be the first female president, right?
0|I only clicked since I was actually curious that someone could manage to come up with a list of reasons to vote for her.
1|Sell more state land.
0|Unless you live in the same state as me, it won't but you're a Bernie/Trump supporter so I don't expect you to understand that.
1|"Now now; that sets a ""negative tone""."
0|And 30,000 going Dem is being very generous.
0|The fact that she has done it before shows that she knows it is sexist, but that is also works.
0|Yep, I will never, ever vote for a Clinton.
1|sorry I didn't know this was required.
0|no, the politics of the supreme court damage public perception.
1|Yeah, but that's, like, the *good* kind.
0|You mean to suggest that Hillary is a cat and Bernie is a clueless little mouse?
0|Too bad he wasn't aborted.
0|Fred
0|Now I understand the logic behind the policies.
1|I'll admit, I kind of want to watch the country spiral into anarchy so I can finally go on that really long camping trip I've been looking forward to.
1|Oh, come on...what could go wrong?
0|No, everybody wants to rule the world.
0|I have a feeling that a second dump is going to show all the Western involvement, and then this is going to look super hypocritical
0|People could say what they want about min wage and all but capitalism is working which is why some of the most advanced technology has come about.
1|She started it!
0|Yaaaasss queen
0|ITT: Nobody is real, everyone is a shill
0|This is a pretty willfully ignorant argument, I'd expect better in here.
0|He said he would release past years as well.
1|Well, you changed my vote with 12 seconds of an interview
0|I'd put money on it that the shooters were not using CA compliant firearms and magazines.
1|You forgot this
1|That's just more establishment math.
0|I'm just thankful that Bernie's plan put Hillary into a position where she felt the need to respond with a plan of her own.
1|Independents are extremists that show little desire to support a corrupt government.
0|I'm guessing she falls down and gives herself a concussion when things start looking bad for her.
1|Listen, all we need to do is weaken encryption and add back doors to and this issue will resolve itself.
1|why do you people always have to drag the spouse into it?
1|That's sexist.
0|Their opinions are awful.
1|"You misspelled ""MSM bias."""
1|Hillary is always thinking on another level,her grasp of the issues is awe inspiring,!
0|3.4 million donations at the time of FEC discrepancy
1|there's an implicit
1|But what if Hillary's right and only white people are hard-working?
1|A reporter, reporting about an issue he is assigned to cannot possibly be telling the truth!
0|Bernadette Warren
1|But how would you humiliate those ~~poor~~ lazy people who ~~can't find~~ won't work?
1|But but you can't be racist towards white people.
0|Who will be strong and stand with me?
0|Oh c'mon, you can live somewhere real nice for that amount: Gary, Indiana.
0|I will never vote for a super predator like Clinton
1|Obviously they would never invite him without him asking first.
1|Be careful you don't step on his 1st Amendment rights!
0|It should be a concerning proportion at the very least, and probably not the best group to condescend to and shrug off.
1|I'm sure those super donors will love *that*
1|At least this time it wasn't an airport bathroom or with rent-a-boy prostitutes
0|Proof would be that his listeners swayed a likely win to one candidate, and altered the outcome to benefit another candidate.
1|Yes, because Bill is such a racist.
1|Right because the evidence is *clearly* on her side.
1|Remember young voters are uniformed idiots, unless they are voting for Trump or Hilary.
0|"""I'm a Bernie supporter, but..."""
1|All torture shall be forbidden.
1|But Obama is tough on the finance industry, Dodd-Frank and such.
0|I watch CNN, Fox, and MSNBC I don't sit there with a video camera.
1|Yes, let's not scare people with what might happen if we get it wrong: death, disease, destruction; better to let everyone go about in a bubble.
1|Yea, I hate the idea of affordable health care
1|Now they hit the snake with the stick like so:
1|Yeah, shame on those Sanders supporters for not registering in October to vote for a guy who had very little name recognition at the time.
0|So this is how democracy dies, by a cunt whose name literally means suckermountain.

1|Please tell me you forgot to add an
1|stupid idealist's with their stupid idealism!
1|That attitude will definitely help unify the party if she's the nominee
0|Is that supposed to sound like Nigel Thornberry?
1|Well it looks like another failed attempt at socialism... Maybe if you try it in America it will work better
1|Thanks for the insightful article as always salon
0|Its kind of immoral to keep taking donations from the average kid he keeps saying he's trying to help once it's not possible for him to win the nomination anymore.
0|But there's beer.
1|"When we said we wanted people to participate, we didn't really mean to ""participate""."
1|Private parties dawg they can do what they want and it's perfectly fine
0|ignorant people associate socialism with communism
1|Yea but ... hmm ... US is really huge and diverse?
0|I know a bit
1|Yes, having your registration changed without your permission using a forged signature *after* the cutoff date for registration changes is *totally* the voters fault.
1|Ugh what the heck this takes forever
0|I thought Hillary represented Bill?
1|Nope, according to Politifact, the only perks Sanders can receive are illegal bribes.
1|wow must be great for the NBA to have the right to refuse buisness with people they dont like

0|It was rhetorical.
1|Applaud the
1|You're talking crazy.
0|Why is trump evil?
0|Obama won them over, while I like Sanders more, and I think he has more substance, he doesn't have the charisma of Obama.
1|Yes, because there has never been a mass movement more willing to sit down, shut up and follow orders from on high.
0|they're yuuugeeeee
0|I think you misunderstand ... the male homosexual voters think he dictates poorly.
0|How does the addition of a large group of people who don't want to participate in warfare make an army more effective?
1|this thread is definitely representative
1|dude, those injuns just got small pocks and disappeared from the continent coincidentally... damn conspiracy theorists
0|If she gets elected we may as well call it the Ivory Tower not the White House
1|He lost, so the fact that he won 40% of the vote running against a candidate with the most name recognition in the world means nothing
1|After recently directing the State Department to transfer Aid to Israel for the country to use to contribute to her campaign...
1|But if a male candidate used a finger jab you wouldn't even notice.
1|Well the American justice system puts minimal effort into actual rehabilitation, so in a way they still are criminals, right?
1|Thanks Reagan
0|You're hilarious.
0|What if they had a take over and no one gave a fuck?
1|Muh freedom
0|This is great bumper sticker stuff, but there is zero evidence that shows that killing terrorist leaders makes for more terrorists.
1|But Socialism is bad.
1|Reminds me of Scott Walker, another brilliant GOP money manager.

1|This is really adding a lot to the political discussion here.
1|Yeah don't trust your doctors, folks.
1|Judging by his username, there is no way his statement is biased.
1|He only seems to be attracting them.
1|First take the money, then shame them.
0|Elizabeth Warren, only female senator with chutzpah.
1|Yes vote republican the party of peace.
0|The real sad part is that the DNC has fucked this up so much that I didn't realize there was a debate until just now (around 7pm) and I actually follow this shit relatively closely.
0|Poor guy
0|I finally realized why I hate Debbie Wasserman Schultz as much as I do: She's the living embodiment of Dolores Umbridge
0|No one is forcing you to use Reddit.
0|"You left off the vast conspiracy constantly attacking her for being ""progressive"""
0|I think Claire Underwood is based on her
1|Well that settles that!
1|Except for gays right?
0|Holy shit, did you even read what he wrote?
0|So is he going to pay you?
1|Yeah just look at all the pro hillary posts that make it to the front page
1|Just wait till after the debates, Sanders gonna crush her.
1|There's no difference between Gore and Bush anyway.
1|K. Thanks for the valuable insight.
1|The Democrats are losing the Reddit vote by acknowledging women exist.
0|Pretty sure he outspent Hillary in Iowa.
0|fiscally conservative
0|if that's the case then he's really playing the long con, since he's been saying some pretty racist shit long before his presidential bid.
1|no its 4/3rds
1|He's hurting feelings left and right, the man is a menace!
1|Well, the other two are dead so shooting them wouldn't do much.
0|It was a nice tie to wear for such a close loss.
1|These Dems and their war on water
1|Right, because being one of the people corrupting the political process with money is so much better than being one of the politicians corrupted by money
1|Yes, because that's surely an accurate depiction and not hyperbolic
1|Oh shit, I didn't know that!
0|Stop giving this cunt and her demonic offspring attention.
1|I mean, pull up your pants already, amirite?
1|Username checks out
1|yea but then it would put the health insurance companies out of business and that means job losses.
1|Must be a conspiracy
1|But if someone is bad you must treat them as 100% wrong.
1|Because in times of near-record income and wealth inequality, what this nation needs is a plutocrat for President.
1|no...
1|Because you need to go pick a new outfit, that one is hideous
1|Vote for Second Best of 2008!
0|Last report I saw showed in the ballpark of about 3.5T
1|*sigh*
1|Bernie Sanders: Americas first REAL Black President?
1|Must have been all those ditzy women that were supporting Trump to attract boys
1|Clinton: So like with a Sharpener?
1|There's a special place in hell for you...
1|Why would we trust Iran for this unprecedented betrayal of citizens firbthr gain of republican politicians?
1|It's called Democratic Socialism.
0|I think he would easily have the highest number of votes for a 3rd party candidate we've ever seen.
1|OH GREAT, BERNIE BROS AT IT AGAIN ATTACKING LEWIS... UNACCEPTABLE, RACIST, etc, etc..
0|I've started arbitrarily describing things as muscular when talking to Hillary supporters.
0|He could also point out that Hillary's lead shrunk by 2/3 in 3 months.
1|Because taking away the cops make the streets much safer!
1|But yeah he's no Barrack, though...
0|Or they prefer him to Clinton.
1|Take the entire Middle East with eminent domain and make a Trump Hotel and Casino!
1|yeah, the SENATE is gerrymandered.
0|I love Bernie and all, but are we jerking to the left or right in this circle?
0|But will the DNC eventually give up and support Sanders at the end of the primaries?
1|I dropped something
1|Yeah, b/c Democrats were go-along-to-get-along when Bush was in power.
1|FINALLY some dirt on this guy.
1|They paid him to put the pillow on his face not take it off
1|Well he has a super PAC so no doubt John Stewart is pulling Steven's puppet strings!
1|In their special place in Hell, because they aren't helping each other.
1|When Bernie is coronated we will make sure you only get quarter portions for the rest of your miserable life as you sit on your state provided couch and watch the state provided TV with state provided proganda
1|But...but....which bathroom would they use?
0|The only downside for insurance companies is that they can no longer fleece their customers and pay huge bonuses to executives because 80% of premiums HAVE to go towards medical expenses.
1|You're just being sexist and racist for claiming there are low information voters.
1|Hey if you can't deal with twice the tax burden you obviously don't deserve to be in business
1|He showed a lot of respect by not going to his funeral too
1|Yep, the real world is nothing but a bunch of ones and zeros that manifest themselves as a site on the internet.
1|He doesn't have to do shit Establishment scum!
1|It's for the free stuff right?
1|This race is close, just give Bernie some time and that 52 point difference won't matter.
1|I don't know if I would be happy associating with Spike Lee after what he did to NBA2K.
1|Good thing Sanders consistently shows himself to have such a great grasp of foreign policy!
1|The National Review has been so dead on with their predictions about Trump that I am sure this one would work.
1|We thank your people for your votes.
0|Which is why she shouldn't be sharing privileged information via unsecured unsecured servers...
1|But beer is a ln American past time.. unlike that God damn hippy weed.

0|A lot of people do not believe in any gods but will not call themselves an Athiest.
1|No guns?
0|Is O'Malley speaking in defense of brutal dictators or decades long occupation of places we help overthrow said dictators?
1|Is it because he's black?
1|Like Benghazi?
1|Yeah, because forcing people who don't know anything and don't give a shit would surely stuff the ballot boxes with the most qualified candidates.
1|Hey I went to the same store twice today and paid sales tax twice, fuck the government right?
0|Since he was black, the highest ranking JROTC member in the country in a big city, I think we can assume his acceptance, especially it was offered by a **GENERAL**.
0|that's an impressive resume and all but I drank in college a bit and here's my opinion
1|yeah but what about all of the hardworking people who have more than 250k in the bank
1|solar power?
0|background noise that is actually realistic
1|Yes, let's just get rid of all the insurance rules and regulations, and surely quality of care will improve!
1|Safety nets are for losers
1|Then clearly we need to start more wars.
1|You forgot the
0|Care for some more tea party?
1|Which is completely discriminatory, there's nothing in the Constitution about having to wear clothes!
1|Yes, because the GOP that can't even pass a highway bill without simultaneously trying to deregulate Wall Street and not pay for half of it will go along with an infrastructure and health plan proposed by Hillary Clinton.
1|Yeah forget about clinton's sound bite focus on Bernie's sound bite
1|Yea because Sanders answered everything directly
1|No more immigrant students or vacationers!
1|Yep, now than Jindal dropped out it is pretty much over
1|Small Government FTW!
1|I think he forgot the
1|Ahh trickle down racism... Because trickle down economics has worked so well
0|[citation needed]
1|Yes of course Hillary is for playing an even hand in the middle east.

1|"Yeah, cause ""trickle down"" economics was such a huge success"
0|Then why did he leave immediately when he found out that ABC was investigating his role?
1|But the media told me Obamacare was a big success!
1|You don't understand, the fact that there is absolutely no evidence of all the things she's been accused of just means that she is too good at covering it up.
1|I cannot imagine why
1|Yup I have mine so fuck everyone else
0|Finally a sane person.
1|The polls don't support my views so they must be wrong
1|WOW WHAT A HERO
1|A reasonable argument... Plausible assumption on the public's mindset... YOU HILLARY SHILL!
1|This is great because Mississippi is an important state for Democrats in November.

0|Why would they offer immunity unless they know what he will tell the investigators?
0|Just goes to show that for a bucket of KFC that man will say anything
0|LOL he's the THIRD different actor to play The Hulk in the last 15 years.

0|and we'll have 9GAG pay for it!
1|I'm sure those Hillary supporters are feeling warm and cozy they could help out the struggling Clinton's.
1|He's a old white politician, theres no way he can be sensitive to the needs of black people.
1|But he's more electable!
1|Don't forget homophobe too!
0|Well said, thank you.
0|And all the best words!
1|I heard he also wants to start segregating university housing again.
1|But he was mansplaining all over Hillary
0|Socialized *insurance* probably.
1|You forgot the
1|Better get those lunatic conservatives off the bench!
1|Yeah cause warfare will make the US better.
0|And people who want an honest president.
0|They will probably try to blame Bernie Sanders, the Hillary Clinton campaign is so Republican in nature.
0|It is an absolute absurdity that this is legal
0|"He dosent ""flip flop"" he just flipped."
0|"And the classic ""a small loan of a million dollars"""

0|BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
0|-pocket sand-!
0|"And how ""successful"" are you, pray tell?"
0|You're overestimating the voters attention span.
0|Can the layman read the part where it says somone who will be 18 at the time of the general may vote in the primary or do you skip that part and make uninformed commentary instead?
0|oh god, here we go
0|Wouldn't be hard to figure out who wins...
0|These type of comments are why actual political discussion on this sub is shit.

1|Yeah, all of his supporters are like that..
0|His hair gets in his eyes.
0|We're claiming turf now?
0|Isn't that the only thing he has?
1|Hurray trickle down economics!
0|She can do both, why not?
0|Because they're shit scared of the Republicans, but fail to notice their candidate is just as corrupt and rotten.
0|Only one candidate has had multiple out breaks of violence before today
0|You sound like a person who hasn't had to fight for much in life.
0|it'll be enough to kill the Dem party this cycle... say hello to President Trump
0|yes
0|But it affects them less, that was my point.
0|It's his entire career that's in question, I was just using one recent example
0|And sometimes, if it looks and smells like shit, it's shit.
1|no dude, it's Bernie's fault somehow
0|Duckworth is a sellout for neoconservatives like hillary clinton
0|That would be a little too close to democracy for the democratic party's liking.
0|You're not exactly helping the profile of your guy, here.
0|But, that would be at the states level so it would be all rainbows and freedom^TM at stuff.
1|Isn't the end just another beginning?
0|I guess all that Republican talk of Liberty and Freedom only applies to rich people and their companies.
1|Oh no he's racist again

1|Yeah, because this is totally constitutional at all.
0|... this week.
1|Just like they destroyed her with Benghazi right
1|Right because Republicans really learned a lesson from 2008 and 2012
0|Reminds me of when Hillary said something similar about Obama.

0|You and me have no right to see personal emails.
0|Canada: the fact hat of America

0|But no one is saying what Obama did was right.
0|Not a scientific poll or anything, but from what I have seen, it seems that some Sanders supporters support Trump because if they cant have the change Sanders brings they want to burn the house down with Trump
0|And boogers.

1|Oh well in that case, all the data and evidence we have to the contrary must be wrong.
1|Yep, I've never seen a company make a charitable donation for any reason other than political favors.
0|Considering the revenues of each of those companies exceeds the GDP of 2/3 of those countries... the companies might just win in court...

0|I feel like logical middle ground would be don't support a person who is in danger of indictment.

0|It's probably better to make the argument about stagnation rather than becoming poorer.
0|Sure she has an obligation to do her job, making light of the victim's circumstances and attacking the character of the victim may be her job.. but that doesn't make those actions any less monstrous.
1|More taxes is the clear solution.

0|I voted for you twice, Carter, wtf?
1|Then why bother
1|Well she is a women so that makes it okay.
1|Because we need more programs like affirmative action, fuck white people!
1|You know that taxes are just arbitrary, not compulsory, you don't really have to pay them according to the law.
1|Laws don't apply to the Clintons.

1|Surely this will affect the polling numbers.
0|What about a gun, knife, or anything sold at Walmart when she sat on the board being used as a weapon?
1|Shut up and get in line with the party!
0|Your friend made the choice to not have health insurance, then decided not to go to the doctor, and you're blaming his death on our healthcare system being marginally worse than it could be?

1|Nice attempt at correcting a certain record and marginalizing us!
1|Hillary is Nixon reincarnate
1|Since this is Russian propaganda and not American I guess she has done nothing wrong.

1|I forgot white people can't be victims, and forgive me for not apologizing while looking down in shame as you randomly yell at me for Jim Crow laws.
0|Because I dont need to see their breast in public spaces, I have no interest for it, and it annoys me and many others; its not like they will get thrown in jail for it; its a misdemeanor.

1|to be fair it's only their natural reaction to Obama crashing the economy in 2008, starting the war in Iraq, and dividing the Country!

0|Just do some re-branding: New Zealand!
1|That must be why the NRA is opposed to legalization.
1|Darn right, Those childish and mindless men cannot be trusted to manage their own bodies.

0|I don't know what is worse : if the ones saying it is a hoax believe it, or not.
0|Not surprised.
0|Except for trends which are still tracking Sanders momentum.
1|Or, you know, we can resign ourselves to the same-old politics that have landed our Congress to an astounding 11% approval rating.

1|BUT REMEMBER BOTH PARTIES DO IT AND ARE THE SAME GUYS!1!
1|thank you a lot, i'm so greatful
1|Yes, I guess his books and ideas, his intellect, his way of reasoning and argumentation were all Mehh.. But being waterboarded, now that shows a guys true wit!
0|Hahaha this is great
1|Yes, people should only be allowed to change job is there is absolutely zero conflict of interest with their new position!
0|Because it's a basic economic fact in any regulated market that the regulations add cost burden.
1|Buy Bernie is just a circlejerk
0|What the fuck.
1|There's a special place in hell for her.
1|If everyone around me would just die, maybe my bus would be on time.

1|It's okay, you're clearly not a Mexican or a Muslim so who cares right?

1|Yeah, Obama's been *great* at asserting his administration's opposition to settlement building.
1|Gee, that was convincing.
0|I think you don't have to support Trump to see that idea is ridiculous.
1|Ah yes, Protestants are truly underrepresented in American government
1|That was probably back before the dementia set in.
1|Oh yes the donald with all his prosperity has really brought the hellfire over us in the past 40 years.
1|Goddamn, Bernie Sanders is such a broken record!
0|salty much?
1|Yeah, they should be greatful for their meager earnings.
1|That's nothing
1|Typical CEO of some random company endorses the establishment candidate
1|Yeah I hear that the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 did wonderful things for black communities.
1|So if you start with a turd, no amount of advertising will make it shiny?
1|But.. But.. She's a progressive..
1|those millions of dollars in her personal account are a left wing conspiracy
1|I have to admit, it is a bold demonstration of leadership.
1|He did not have sexual relations with that woman.
1|Yeah, in the same sense that a communion wafer is just a wafer.
1|Bernie Sanders is the only small government personal liberties constitutionalist candidate
1|Everyone knows a murderer will follow school policy!
1|But as the CEO he was never charged, apparently all of his underlings were thoroughly corrupt and he didn't know about it.
1|Yeah because the government is doing such a wonderful job with the VA lets just let them take over the rest of the health care industy!
1|BENGHAZI
1|She's clearly someone who should be president.

1|The best and the brightest Alabama has to offer.
1|"""I never had a strong opinion about this before now, but since the Republicans did this I'm whole-heartedly convinced that this is what the **Founders** intended."""

1|"""As long as they're christian"""
0|What a crazy world we live in where a political figure can not only say this and actually mean it, but there are a group of people who would actually think of this as an applause line.
1|just like how much compassion the US is showing to your fellow Syrian men right now
1|I don't need no damn book telling me I came from no damn monkey.
0|Why do you think the American populace would fair better than the countries our military and private military contractors subjugate?
0|We're currently having a hard time helping our own people succeed, we can't even provide proper health care for our veterans, and our social security programs are going down the tubes, sure lets help some Syrians out.
0|He's trying to say that they make news out of small things like that.
1|Yeah, this one person will completely change the outcome of that election!
1|Yup, any day now
1|Yes that one speech managed to destroy Hillary supporters' spirit, make her go broke, evaporated her ground game, and polls are now showing she is losing by 30 points becuase of that one single good speech.
1|Yeah I don't like reading news I don't agree with either...
0|l m f a o
1|Any Republican who goes against Trump is obviously a neocon or RINO.
0|Many who weren't allowed to vote in closed primaries also see it, in addition to 45% of the Dem party.
1|It's gotta be because of her principled campaigning, her guts in speaking truth to power, and impeccable honesty.
1|But muh rational self interests...
1|It was a Glock AR-15
1|I'm with her!
0|For some.
1|You forgot the
1|Depends which day you ask him.
0|I don't but thanks.
1|Yeah, based on bills past, he should know better than to do something stupid!
1|Obviously Hillary should have solved a thousand years of conflict in the 4 years she was SoS.
1|yes, because the traffic on a subreddit is a reliable, valid sample.
1|The media will learn to not question the great leader.
1|That's why I buy 20 lottery tickets every week
0|This has to be a satirical account.
1|Yeah, she probably spent it performing abortions!
0|"""You know I like that sandwich, he was always there for me back in my picnic days"" - Frail old lady voice."
1|explanation for the low voter turn out on the democratic side right here
1|Good plan!
1|You dropped this
1|Primary sources don't count if they're shared by partisan third parties, don't you know?
0|This is an argument in favor of fixing the bureaucratic nightmare that is the federal government, not against a simple measure to combat fraud.
1|No it's all just a Republican smear campaign.
1|if I want to give your tax dollars to my rich buddy to send his personal security forces overseas to practice COD3 game but live action who are you to say I can't isn't this a free damn country?
1|Some walls work for some things therefore all walls work for anything you want.

0|That booger really trickled down!
0|"There is a difference between ""i"" and ""they"""
1|How dare you work towards meeting societal expectations!
1|Integrity is for losers
1|Yeah cause if there is one thing Hilary is bad at, it's answering questions she has had time to prepare for and defending herself against republicans.
0|as a Bernie supporter, this offends me.
1|Nooo, there's no such thing as Nazis, that's all fearmongering bullshit.
1|Yes, but remember it's only censorship if the government does it.
1|Yeah, if only we had poll taxes and tests to weed out the wrong kind of voters.
1|Goldman Sachs in no way whatsoever believes they will benefit from thousands and thousands in donations and speaking fees to Hillary.
1|Lol shut up you commie, free college is bad cause that's socialism.
1|wow, I totally thought you were wrong at first, but now that you're using a larger font it's clear that you must be right.
1|Dem voting for Trump if Sanders loses.
0|Did they cover the secret ability to turn location data on even though the owner has turned it off?
0|The one who shall be named.
1|Oh, that'll help
1|I thought Watergate was about the Flint water scandal.
0|Alito has been terrible.
0|I would argue that he shouldn't be, but I guess that's beside the point.
0|Kind of looks like coming out to endorse Trump was a way to jump on his popularity, for some financial gain, we do all notice he isn't calling on her for help.
0|Hillary's numbers continue to shrink, the the differences are declining not growing.
0|Hillary Clinton is going to be brought to heel real soon now.
0|Some of the posts are certainly so far off the reality beam they could cause a slip into outer space if not careful.
0|Take me to your dealer.
0|Do you grasp the concept that there were many, many problems, and that this fixed some of them but not all of them?
0|Lmao so your argument is that since neither of them did anything, it's better that Clinton did nothing for a shorter period of time?
0|They support gay marriage and common sense economic policy, it's weird that the left takes issue with those things...
0|She can't get her pant suit dirtied from mingling with commoners
0|It is already against the law it's just not enforced.
0|I plan to.
0|He can become the Senate Leader - just probably not a Democratic Senate Leader.
1|Good I hope he breaks out the fema camps and starts confiscating guns soon I get tired of all this talk
1|It disagrees with my preexisting beliefs so I am going to assume you are wrong and put my fingers in my ears.
0|Yup it really is a shame, I wish people were more educated and less religious I honestly think that would solve a lot of problems in the US
0|me too, i look forward to these so much
0|Im sure all of the people who invited her to the event and Bill Deblasio arent on her side....go back to infowars.
0|Ooh...see prejudice is more of a Republican thing...
0|Instead you lose an incentive to mitigate fraud, because now you don't bear the consequences of not vetting things.
0|With all the flavors, you pick salt?
1|But free markets!
0|Expect a knock on your door from the NSA soon.
0|Good.
1|White people dont know what it's like to be poor though!
0|At what point does constant targeted protesting become stifling others free speech?
0|And their leader is more than likely about to win the republican nomination.
1|What an enlightened assessment..
0|Oh ok I just wanted to make sure which wife you were talking about.
0|You don't need to be a genius to know who she is talking about...
1|Well, I guess that's the whole point, isn't it?
0|There are more productive things to do than build a wall
0|Who do you think throws these parties?
0|'Nigger' and 'woman' are synonymous?
0|Why would a political organization allow visible protestors disrupt a rally?
0|How will he ever staff his resort in Florida without bringing in foreign workers?
0|Just another NYShitPost.
0|oh please cut the crap, Trump is no example of success.
0|That doesn't change the fact that they're stupid.
0|He's saying it's not surprising because most Bernie supporters are college students.
0|Holy shit.
0|How can you say the majority of republicans don't like trump when he is *dominating* the primary
1|Now there are going to be even more toddlers with access to guns...
0|See, Sanders and Clinton supporters *can* agree!
0|Play your guitar on your Mtv
0|Which is funny because of the desk Hillery is hoping to sit at...
0|He is.
0|It's really funny when Bernie supporters pick up debunked right wing talking points.
0|The bigger problem is that sin and pigovian taxes have the nasty side effect of the government becoming dependent on growing revenue from the very thing it was supposed to suppress.
0|They need to be able to mute mics.
0|Protests can be peaceful and abide the law, they can be peaceful while practicing civil disobedience, and they can be non peaceful.
1|That's just paying the fine early
0|I think if a gunman shoots up the steps of the capital building, the survivors will quickly vote to do something.
1|You stinky liberal, you!
0|Looks like she's on pace to take 70+ more delegates than Sanders here.
1|Dang, he was so close to that 60% you mentioned too.
1|But having a temper tantrum instead will REALLY show them!
1|If the Bernie bros don't show up for Hillary, then they are sexist pigs.
0|I like how both sides are avoiding another bush
0|Those are smears and allegations and you know that.
0|Last I saw votes were still being counted, and it's literally on the edge.
0|And the people responsible for whether or not to shut down Guantanamo got elected without promising that.
0|You nailed it with the coke analogy
0|Tell that to Ted Cruz.
0|Well if Bernie gets elected and we somehow make college tuition free, then you will probably see a bump in people applying to be doctors, since they wouldn't have to go 100,000 dollars in debt to do it.
0|So you think we should not have built the Interstate because it was thought up by the Nazis.
0|Well, he cares for his country.
0|Yeah, fuck me for only caring about the rights of a small minority
0|Oh weird I thought it was supposed to be his most powerful ad
0|Who said he did?
0|Yeah but they said they had a right to protest so we let them stay
1|Right that's totally the attitude we see from most top comments in these threads
1|dependency and inability to support ones self... doesnt sound worse at all... Good thing the world is always going to be willing to sell us the stuff we want at the prices we want it...
1|Both of them are called 'literally' Hitler, both of them are being called racists, both of them are being called sexists!
0|"""If he steals my women, I shall steal his Jews!"""
0|Thank you for your reasonableness.
0|Same with anyone who took and passed economics.
1|nah anyone who isn't for sanders is a dumb uninformed shill.
1|Geez, just get over it already.
1|"Because ""Hilary can't focus on trump"" as if that's a real concern, if Hillary has it so tied up why would it hurt her have Bernie still in the race, after all Americas overwhelming choice is obviously Hillary"
0|It's what I've been saying, too, but nobody's listening.
0|I'm sure you can think up at least a dozen reasons why not having anonymous ballots is a terrible, awful idea.
0|Let them fight.
0|"Is that like ""every true black person cares about this""?"
0|A lot of Bernie supporters who probably never even heard of men like John Stuart Mill or Friedrich Engels.
0|Lulz
0|you're probably right ... but then this campaign is about more than the election (it really is, contrary to what people might think.)
0|and they are beginning to realize that there isn't much of a difference between neoliberals and neocons.
1|B-but...learning new systems is soooooooo *hard*.
0|This *doctor* doesn't even understand gravity and the mathematics for that are much simpler than economics.
1|Who is this Kasich guy I keep hearing about?
0|I'm going to rethink my stance on this...
1|But didn't Citizens United make it legal for corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to campaigns?
0|"You could write in for 3rd Party ""Monica Lewinsky"""
0|More less exactly what I expected.
1|Yes, let's blame all billion-plus Muslims for the acts of these extremists
0|A demographic of the electorate, yes.
1|If people keep upvoting Bernie articles, he'll get the nomination.
0|Wow, really stretching the goalposts again, huh?
1|Yeah, security laws and procedures, who needs them right?
0|Attack ads don't have to be perfect arguments, they just have to make him look bad.
1|Yeah right and wrong don't matter when you can cling to a technicality right?
1| 6 - Because Donald Trump will make a great president.
1|Wow that must mean she's against money in politics now
1|Yo Bernie, you dropped this
1|I think you dropped this
1|all politicians do it
1|Yeah, fucking blacks can vote now
1|You're a burden because you don't subscribe to socialistic policies that would benefit me!
0|Alright then remember to stand up every once in a while and stretch.
0|I really wish John Oliver would address this
0|Yep, that is all I was suggesting, we organize in there and it is really helpful.
0|He isn't going to deliver anyways.
0|But anti Clinton women can't be feminists
0|How do you feel about Sanders support of the Afghanistan invasion?
0|Not much, as long as they did a good job then its whatever.
1|Yes, we should base our view of muslims on a fantasy image of them and not reality, that would be racist
0|As someone who dislikes Sander almost as much as his tax-and-spend, and is contemptuous of HRC, Sanders beat her(quite handily) in multiple debates.
1|Yeah not like every single post democratic debate poll hasn't shown Bernie Sanders winning.
1|Because he is the future.
1|It should only be available to the wealthy, obviously
1|Yay, democracy.
1|Because all Hillary supporters are paid shills

0|Cinco!
0|That's what I assume he'll do
0|As a Hillary supporter, what I'd love to see is Bernie spend money/energy supporting down ticket liberals in primaries (like Donna Edwards in Maryland) who are the kind of people Congress needs to make the legislation Bernie supports an actual, feasible option.
1|Down voted for sexism
0|A point that is meaningless when you examine how each of their campaigns are funded in fundamentally different ways.
0|Dick Cheney
0|Why does anyone need to waste fifteen minutes of their life because you don't want to present information in a quickly digestible fashion?
1|Remember its all lies from Sanders, she hasn't taken any money.
1|Yeah maybe Bernie should create an email scandal just for all the extra press!
0|I would argue that it needs to come alongside cost controls so that equipment and medicine costs less to the hospitals.

0|Demographics.
1|And the Gulf will finally be restored, and those who've suffered reimbursed.
0|I do wonder how many current Trump voters would bother to vote in the general election if Trump isn't on the ballot.
0|I sure hope so, cause the Abbott/Patrick Looney Tunes Gang gets scarier every day.
0|The establishment hates him!
1|Yeah dissolving the Iraqi army was brilliant move that insured victory and stability in the country.
1|56% right now but I thought bernie was doomed
1|So sexist.
0|Is this what you say to people who are correct?
1|The aimless hatred of Trump supporters reflects so well on him
0|"More proof that people are indeed ""coming for our guns"" Yet another example to show when people claim ""no one is coming for your guns"" There are tons of people like this who praise australia confiscation and want it replicated here, like Hillary Clinton for example."

1|Dude, if you're so successful, why bother caring about *other people*?
1|Wow, I'm sure all of those people you know would've made a dent in the Florida vote

0|Err, what do you mean?
0|Would make sense considering his credit probably got trashed in his 20s
0|Maybe when Republican voters aren't crazy, racist, fascist nutjobs
1|Well how do you fill your office with sexy women if you don't promote them up to the top floor?
1|Ah more American 'journalism'.
1|Relevant article, credible news source
1|"Yeah, this ""biased"" CNN sure did a great job doctoring such a pro-Clinton audience"

1|A Nobel Prize in economics and $3.50 will get you a coffee at Starbucks, am I right?
0|And yet Clintonites get mad at me when I say I won't vote for her in the general (not you, just generally).
1|At least you're not paranoid

0|I dont think anyone would expect or force a Muslim caterer to serve a pork BBQ spread...
1|"He already said it, ""revolution"" don't you read?"
0|She went full retard.
1|I'm sure this guy has video of Hillary standing over all of them with a knife, just like she did with Vince Foster
0|This answers my question how?
1|but obviously you're voting against your own self interests, because you had thoughts that aren't the same as mine
0|Can you invite me to your fantasyland?
1|Yes, smug redditors who believe the best way to save everyone is to write Trump on everything before setting it aflame are so much better.
0|I'm in my macroeconomics class talking about free trade and my teacher was about to make fun of Trump, but gave us the disclaimer that he might vote for him because he hates Hillary's guts.
1|You're right it's a completely insignificant position with little to no effect so why should we care if someone stole it.
0|Trump will be president as most BS supporters will not vote for Hillary.
0|To extend our reach to the stars above!
1| MAGA MAGA, CUCKS EVERYWHERE, TRUMP IS COOL.
1|But I bet if people look at your post history they'll see a clear pattern of you saying pro-Hillary things - that has to mean you're a paid shill or a bot, right?

0|Do you have any understanding of Citizens United and how it relates to Hillary Clinton?
0|Rubio has been openly fantasizing about how great it would be for him if the election was Rubio vs Sanders.
1|yeah *if* he doesn't get the nod
0|Footings says vote for me because I fabricate horrific lies and slander to attempt to defund planned parenthood.
0|I wouldn't have voted for her in 2008 and i definitely won't vote for her now.
1|Because they totally have nothing to talk shit on trump about
1|Yeah, screw the will of the voters, the candidate I like *deserves* the nomination.
0|I mean at least he's honest.
1|That's because the system is rigged against him and the Establishment hates him and people in the south are clearly low information voters who don't know what's good for them.
1|Calm down man, those were only micro-punches and mini-nosebleeds.
0|How so?
1|Well he's just such a good Christian, don't ya know?

1|Cosby doesn't have white privilege
0|lol this deal was specifically constructed to be a big middle finger right in China's face and Trump is whining about how it's a Chinese plot.
0|"Rather than say ""bye bye"" I will just say ""I'm sorry"""
0|shocking comeback from the supporter of a racist
1|This sub is full of fanboys in general, fucking disgusting.
1|"Because Obama's ""stimulus"" worked so well right?"
1|I am certain both sides will agree that cutting taxes for the wealthiest will solve all the problems, so why are they divided?
1|Maybe NY Times was expecting them to invoke George Wallace?
1|Oh he obviously loves women as objects he has had so many.

0|Stock up on the popcorn.
0|No matter what questions they ask Bernie he will make sure to go back to income inequality.

0|That makes sense, however you can't argue that there is a large number of people who have been financially wiped out due to the outrageous costs of the US system.
0|lol, that is my bad, had a few to many beers (combined with being dyslexic) i guess that lifts it up a bit, but it really should include comparison to all runners, not just trump i could include a stat that showed Bernie lied X times in his life, but that really means nothing until i compare with the competition
0|Also, Ditka is a white guy in a position of authority over black guys (which in the racist mind is the way it should be), whereas Obama is a black guy in a position of authority over white guys.

1|That means she'll lose men too.... Because the guys are only supporting Clinton to meet girls.
1|They would much rather waste that money keeping you from becoming an entitled little millenial, gen x, etc etc.

1|Since when do we throw peaceful protestors in jail?
0|No you're an asshole because you come off like an asshole.

1|And that could be fudged to look like 100 years
1|Remember: up vote based on quality, down vote based on opinion
0|and how do we find out if somebody has been deemed safe to be in society?............a background check.
0|Bounced on my boy's dick to this for hours.
0|So people who went to college today are still going to be paying off that debt while everyone ahead of them is going for free?

1|Dude he said it himself so you know its true
0|Depends on what 5 minutes you're watching her
1|But how else would we make rural voters' votes count for more than urban voters' votes?
1|Maybe we should just draft women to get pregnant, to make more soldiers.
1|Well, obviously it doesn't work in sports, otherwise New England would be in the Super Bowl again.
1|Whats wrong with that?
1|He just couldn't help but slip in that one micro-aggression!
1|When I imagine electing the first woman president it feels good, so it can't be wrong.

1|but his skin is white so he is not a minority
1|That would totally get me hot.
0|See my comments elsewhere in this thread.
1|Yeah, because three strikes was way too lenient.
0|Looks like it's a lot lighter on the republican side.
1|states that have large white populations are obviously not as representative as South Carolina and it's 55% African-American electorate in Dem primaries.

1|No, the government creates jobs.
1|Everyone in Nevada must be an establishment shill then.

1|No no, we are all for tolerance and open mindedness, everyone is welcome here...
0|LMAO I didn't see the camel toe
1|I think you dropped this.
1|Yes because reddit accounts for more than 1% of the vote
1|In her defense she didn't know she was on camera.
1|Innovation!
1|Not endorsing Bernie is basically endorsing Clinton.
1|Yeah, since SoS's have domestic concerns as their top priority, she and she alone was responsible for that ...
0|Yet there are only 2 blue areas.
1|Well yeah all rich people are dangerous and evil
1|Just wait until after the debates.
1|they will disregard it if its pro-bernie sanders because were all just a bunch of lazy fuckwads who want free shit, we do not pay taxes and we are not old enough to vote
1|Because Trump is no ones second choice.
1|Why would she be tired of BS if she just endorsed him?
1|I'm sure this spot-on analysis will win you many Black voters.
1|But...but....he's basically progun!
0|How many delegates does this give him?
1|You forgot
1|What do they know!
1|Oh no, what a loss.
1|Didn't he renounce his US citizenship when he went off to live in a kibutz?
1|Yeah Christie's right, things are so terrible there
1|Good thing he has such a strong grasp of climate change, evolution, and how to deal with an active shooter
1|But, ya know once they turn 18 it's OK to send people off to war to get killed / kill.

1|They're so unselfish, they don't want to make the lines at the election halls longer for the old people.
0|Just when he was surging towards 1%
1|Maybe they need more tax cuts
1|Highly unusual behavior for a Secretary of State, don't you think?
0|Well.... a lot of people are calling him a liar when it sounds entirely plausible that he's only mistaken about the dates.
1|Nope
1|Well, that's ok because Republicans!

1|yea you're right, fuck being a good person &amp; caring about others
0|Yea, the problem is a lot deeper than the candidate.

1|We should probably also ban quiet, teenage-20 something, introverted white men who have fewer friends than the average kid their age from going to school or church to help stop school and church shootings too, huh?
0|I guess that means nobody is thinking...
0|This is the best joke I will never tell.

0|Well, this will be about as accurate and representative of the American public as a FOX news poll.
0|None of those places are in America maybe the NSA should put some resources into spying on them instead of American citizens?
1|Yeah, because major politicians are not proposing bills on it or anything and have not been trying to push them through.
1|The masses are so addicted to Trump's brand, they'll accept no substitute!
1|But he's Scalia so he's automatically wrong.
0|Just when you can't find a more circle jerky title, Bernie finds a way

1|Ahh yes, a great model for the US.
0|i can't up vote you enough.
1|Every 55-70 year old is committing financial fraud and nobody under that age could possibly be that greedy.
0|There are reports all over that Obama's India trip cost $200 million per day...if it were true.
1|But didn't the kids sign a social contract to take on the debt ?
1|Not raising the debt ceiling : economic terrorism .
0|Money is the good life.
1|Except they will call it 'Romneycare' since you know, Obama stole it from him.
1|No, we obviously need to reelect obama and legalize marijuana.
0|a lot of the world's problems wouldn't exist if we'd never made Langley in the first place
1|Yes, because crazy people cannot obtain anything that is illegal.
1|I guess that's why they never send armed dudes in when there's trouble...
1|Why not go the whole nine yards and just nationalize everything...?
0|If even 0.1% of this towering, obscene mountain of ill-gotten gains was diverted to worthy causes, it would solve world hunger overnight.
1|Who would have guessed !
1|But hey you can post on reddit, so everything must be just fine right?
1|He's going to be a great foreign diplomat when he grows up.
0|Well we wouldn't want to point any fingers as Saudi Arabia...they're out *allies*!
1|They're making sure that evil Kenyan Mooslim gets thrown out so they can give tax cuts to the rich and let the prosperity trickle down, obviously.
1|LOL wow imagine that, wordplay that makes the story a lie and coming from MSNBC...shocking
1|Yeah guy, go use somewhere you can't speak as a way to speak out to people.
1|Money can't trickle down if there are no million/billionaires.
1|I blame  trees
1|well....maybe your dad was being lazy and needed the welfare?
1|Because they will be millionaires like Romney one day!
1|Because only one side does it and it's not politics-as-usual
0|What the hell is Colossal?
1|I would have gone with indefinite detention or torture, but I guess welfare is pretty bad too.
1|Wow this is the first Bush to ever lie to the public.
0|What's funny if it really was the free market, they'd all be homeless after the bank crash.
0|So I'm told by many of the same people that assured me what a great president Obama would be.
1|But WV is his base!
1|Didn't see this coming
1|Yeah, they'd be better off with no job!
0|broken clock
1|Yeah, cause Jennifer Grahnholm did such a bang up job creating jobs here in Michigan.
0|Luckily parts of Texas can have a few miles between houses.
1|They can't be terrorist, they ain't muslim!
1|Only if you're paying for it, and I'm getting it.
1|It's good to see he's taking a break from trying to find out if Obama is a citizen to do some real police work...
1|For the matter at hand, this is a big suprise ...
0|**Rage** Kill everyone!
0|Sounds legit, I'll shelf that with the 'Australia lost the Vietnam War' theory and read them both when I get Alzheimer's.
1|Oh China
0|To which actual marines called out the comments as speculation designed to smear him... Nice, real nice.
1|Send the gays to Iran not to Mars!
0|I hope you're right, it would be great if we actually saw constructive change.
1|Yes, clearly anyone who doesn't move is just asking for their children to be gunned down without consequence.. why do these people hate freedom?
1|Because states laws = Freeeeedoooom!
0|"Obviously the more expensive thing is preferable from the state's point of view, since it's taxpayer money that goes to ""civil servants""."
1|Well, the shooting is a self defense open and shut case then.
1|obviously the government stealing 2.3% of their profits is what is preventing them from creating more jobs.
0|I don't know, but I'm going to pick up some pedant spray.
1|But all they care about is freedom!
1|Yeah unlike  politics where we rationally discuss multiple points of view without fear of censorship
1|No-one, because, of course, abstinence works !
1|It's such a big deal that he said that.
1|Weeden will be our savior this time!
0|Isn't her husband the one that tells her what to do?
1|they hate us because we are free, not because we meddle in all of their affairs!
1|Yup, because having a separate person pay for something than the person who is receiving the benefit of said thing always leads to efficient incentives.
0|i hope ron pauls numbers dont suffer :( i guess no real way of knowing
1|Topical and Radical!
1|Everyone knows that they always tell the truth.
1|You sure proved him wrong.
1|But but but America is run by AIPAC and is a tool of the Israelis!
1|Nope, Koch isn't pulling strings on Walker
1|Yeah, but that won't work over here because we're am important country.
0|Yet the vote will be split much more evenly.
1|It's not straight?
1|Sorry we only operate in a vacuum.
1|So glad to see we are having an intelligent debate.
1|They were clearly agitating those peace officers.
1|Naw man the real way to succeed is to spend all of your time at general assembly trying to build consensus.
1|"It does not mater how a Democrat candidate raises money or who they raise money from, they are the ""good guys"" remember!"
1|Clearly this is why it is better to have local communities with all the power.
0|Gawker is pretty much where the quote-mined quote is from.
1|Did we punish them by giving them a payed holiday?again
0|Ron Paul has a few amazing ideas, however, he's a loony in his own world of bigotry.
1|No we just assume ALL AMERICAN CHRISTIAN EVANGELISTS are intolerant jerks.
1|Give him some time...he has to deal with Bush's mess.
1|Can't I just work and pay taxes and hope someone spends my money in the correct way?
0|Well because he needs to beat Romney, any votes going to Gingrich are effectively a vote for Romney (if you assume like you do that he is a distraction, and does not have a chance of winning) If Gingrich's campaign crashes and burns in the same fashion as the previous Not-Romney front-runners then it becomes very clearly a two man race and much more difficult to marginalize Paul in popular media.
1|I'd like to think it's because the House Judiciary Committee saw my protest and decided to rethink SOLA.
0|It has been since the patriot act.
1|And in America everything is tip top.
1|They're bigots, obviously.
1|This must be fake, congress has never done anything immoral or wrong.
0|I hear the internet has domain registrations now!
0|He has a pair, and he is using them to firmly fuck the working and middle classes.
0|So would you prefer more deadlock?
1|"But... but... who would be our ""enemy""..."
1|But..but..but, we can't believe what he said, he's a terrorist!
0|Because equal taxation is just plain unfair.
1|I feel safer already.
1|But if he's gay, he wasn't defending America, he was *cruising the showers*, obviously.
1|Yes, his speech in the last years clearly indicates he is a rich bastard just like the others.
1|HAHAHA YES BECAUSE PRISON RAPE IS SO HILARIOUS AMIRITE
0|Actually, that phrase sums up American foreign policy since WWII.
1|The solution to an ineffective government is more government.
1|So how does the cost compare to the war in Libya?
1|I just let the dog play with the toys for awhile, if he's still OK in a week I give them to the kids!
1|If that was actually true, the Republicans would have gone completely out of business the last time they caused a Great Depression.
1|But that's all Obama's fault because he won't compromise!
1|Be a democrat.
1|I can't think of a better solution to financial problems than abolishing the Fed, can you?
1|Why do you hate poor people?
1|But make sure you go out and vote for one, so you can change it!
1|So he's always happy?
1|But I thought he was a communist!
1|JUST YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET BACK TO TROOP SUPORTIN'
1|I'm sure it was medicinal cocaine.
0|Touche', upvote.
0|They are coming to get us, I heard it on Alex Jones.
0|You can have those restrictions and still have a profit incentive.
1|Right because basic income is the same as communism.
0|And how do you read that Redacted was a member of the FBI and not some nut job working at Walmart?
0|Enlighten us, how?
0|Troll status: white hot.
0|Am I on Fox News' website all of the sudden?
0|Starbucks has tea, too!
0|Some people think that means 'stop the state from interfering when the church wants to control everyone'.
0|So someone whose landlord refused to fix their fridge, and who has multiple small children should have to buy over-priced small packs of meat/dairy daily?
0|^_^ Thanks.
0|Costco hires the employees they need to operate--to keep up with DEMAND, as does Walmart and pretty much every other company.
0|The headline should read '22% of swing-state voters could have their vote changed by electronic voting machine'
0|Funny, since politics is almost just a sport.
0|"""Cool"" threesomes or ""uncomfortable"" ones?"
0|I think, but may be wrong, that the pre-Murdoch WSJ used to be rational and thoughtful, though.
0|Maybe we'll get lucky and the fiery crash will be directly into Clown hall.
0|He's looking at you Paris Hilton!
0|Yeah, I believe all that trash ... Are all these wingnut type haters such pathological liars?
0|Hell just got a little colder.
0|Well, come January we will have all sorts of automatic cuts to offset the unemployment insurance extensions including more money due to the increase in taxes because Republicans wouldn't cut a deal to avoid the automatic cuts.
0|Never underestimate crazy.
0|The only problem is that illegal immigrants from the Confederate States of America would keep sneaking across the border into the Union States because things would suck so bad there.
0|I've gotten the cup they provide for water at McDonalds and it's like a Dixie cup much smaller than even the small soda/pop cup they give so you would have to go back to the dispenser over and over again with this obviously miniscule cup, making the fact you are stealing the soda/pop pretty oblivious but to make that a felony rather than a misdemeanor is ridiculous.
0|don't forget MickMannock
1|But they are intolerant of racists!
1|It's a good thing that most his economic policies have been blocked, just think of the mess we'd be in if he actually had his way.
0|Oh man, the headlines in the right wing blogosphere would be AMAZING!
0|Well, as long as it isn't the black guy.
0|Because any other color would be..., well..., *gay*.
0|Or when they proselytize by telling would-be converts that Christianity is open to people of all faiths.
0|(and probably lose) Austin doesn't have enough people to compete with the rest of Texas.
1|Yeah, cause the liberal news stations don't push their bias on everybody else either.
0|Then have some dignity, and lose the next election.
0|That's only been happening since the beginning of our country.
1|Color me surprised...
0|They ~~are so deep into~~ *have* the government *completely in their* pockets at this point they are a literal ~~part~~ *owner* of the system.
0|6' can be 200lbs.
0|Lets all agree that the GOP really want to impeach him because he's black, and will use any other reason in an 'attempt' to cover their original motive.
0|"...said Krugman, as he clung on to his Nobel prize and proceeded to put his fingers in his ears and chant ""la la la la I can't hear you la la la la"""
0|please indicate to us how the increases in minimum wage caused the bubble in the housing market and the resulting crash after that bubble popped.

1|Chris was out there working hard setting up cones to ensure the accuracy of the study.
0|Basically, we need union membership to rise again.
0|Fyi burning coal releases more radiation than nuclear, including all past meltdowns and accidents.
0|Yet another part of the problem was that the guy who was in charge of investigating Wall Street fraud, Lanny Breuer, was a total shill.
0|Just like a like a lot of countries have their money in the U.S....
0|That's a happy ~~farmer~~ boss.
0|This man died fighting for his freedom against jack booted thugs.
1|Don't worry, the rich won't just retire or leave the country, they will keep working just as hard and risk their capital for little return rather than enjoying life.

0|Republicans spell compromise, **c a p i t u l a t i o n** But first try moving the goal until everyone screams.
0|Oh it matters a lot more when a black kills a non black.
0|Not very prescient about a program began in earnest by the Dick &amp; Dubya Show before it was made legal by that secret law in 2007.
0|Something worth going to jail for, outraging the haters.
0|That is a false equivalency.
0|That would have excluded pre-existing conditions, and would not have required payment for anything.
0|Doesn't matter how many conservative studies say this, it remains a lie.
0|It is said Reagan did not know of the hostage deal, I could believe that and Gingrich's account of the interview, but Nixon did know about the peace talk treason.
0|But Nate, they have to cover up the vote stealing, blocking.
0|"Point out to your supervisor what a great pr move it would be to announce a ""hold"" on contracts of people affected by the storm."

0|I thought it was a doomsday cult.
0|No, because he's the one who comes up with the lies, and he's the one who gets really rich people to pay the money for the ads.
0|The Republican alternative is to die.
0|I'm the only guy I know who does that and I do it *really* rarely.
0|I agree with everything you said, now explain to me what's bad about the NSA program, I don't get it.
0|Because education is good for everybody and not all people can afford to go to college.
0|Exactly, and they can just take the camera if they see it.
0|They actually didn't support those, and are very reputable in terms of privacy and have a nearly flawless track record, except for a few tarnishes.
1|And here I thought food stamps were the cause for our national debt.
0|The stereotypical bigot aside, the best part is: 'Wait, I'm in that picture'
0|Kucinich isn't running in 2012, sadly.
1|Now all the criminals that have been waiting on baited breath to use their registered firearms to commit crimes can finally breath easier, now that their registered guns can't be tracked back to them.
0|Nope it's a fallacious story kind of like the ones that make conservatives cringe and redditors giddy on fox news.
1|Me too, but really i hate any discussion that doesn't jibe with my opinion.
1|If there's one thing California needs more of, it is state-employed workers and their associated CALPERS pensions.
1|Her childhood of being raised in the most powerful house in the country and attending exclusive private schools, combined with her adult life of living in a multi-million dollar apartment in a very rich area of Manhattan, makes her uniquely qualified to both understand and tackle the problems facing the common folk today.
0|You don't maybe think that people of the same geographic region, who share the same religion, might just view each other as comrades more so than an intervening foreign entity with a different skin color and religion, who just so happen to have a history of frictions with said 'occupiers' in that region?
0|Sorry, hard to follow them all.
0|No sorry, guns did have something to do with this.

0|"It is very hard to see the real Mitt Romney but comments like the one in this article and the 47% seem to be the real Mitt not the statements like ""I'll be be better than Ted Kennedy."""
0|Yet somehow rich people still think we should shut down libraries because they are too expensive.
0|So the judge doesn't exist and he didn't have to reinstate the GOP monitors?
1|Republicans think this is an unnecessary regulatory agency anyway, no one needs the government to keep their food safe, the corporations will do it better.
1|There, all the more reason to NOT have immigration reform.

1|Sounds like a liberal.
0|That's hilarious.. Because it practically makes them null and void.
0|Read the article...
1|It's not socialist when the government gives money to people who don't need it.
1|As opposed to covertly and actively.
0|Its not even arguable - their entire economic plan appears to be borrow to fund tax handouts to the ludicrously rich.
1|your argument is sound and solid.

0|I'm sure there are plenty of Palestinians who given the hardware, would love to supply as close to real time updates as we could expect.
1|It's totally going to happen this time, too!
1|Yes because they are equally to blame.
1|As I have always said its much better for a few hundred thousand children to remain malnourished and wome even starve than for one venture capitalist to see a mild reduction in his standard of living.
0|Well, of couse, if you give the power to the people who won't be in charge, they will ultimently say why it's bad for them, insted of what's good for the people.

0|No one is commenting on his lack of emergency fund to last more than 10-months (and afford private health insurance) even though he was making $125,000 per year?
1|Because when you're elected to PUBLIC office, you should really only give a shit about the people that voted for you.
1|It's almost like all of the branches of government have colluded over time using tiny little legal precedent after precedent to make the idea of a limited government with clearly defined powers a farce

1|Unless it's for marijuana and same-sex marriage.
0|If only these buffoons learned the difference between the legislative branch and the executive, but I guess they're too busy toking up.

1|God will know if you lie and will somehow punish you for it.
1|What a shock to see a politician abandon commitments and allegedly closely-held morals once in office.
1|Yeah average americans are well equipped to make that distinction, he'll be fine.
1|Wow that ticket seemed to have a coherent, consistent message, but now I don't know...
1|Yep, and look how good the NSA and CIA are at keeping things under wraps.
1|I'm sure you can effectively take them to court in a timely, affordable fashion and get it all sorted out.
1|Nothing like abusing government power to make people more willing to accept more restrictions on their constitutional right to defend against a corrupt government.
0|...and then you blame the media for trying to spin your goodwill and generosity into something terrible... standing ovation, fuck a hooker after the debate.
1|we should definitely run away from 'tyranny' into the hands of capitalism
1|Well now that you put it that way, I guess I have no choice but to accept your speculation as concrete evidence.
1|yeah, facts and data clearly have a librul agenda and are in the tank for Obama.
1|But what if Jason Bourne happens to be in Cuba at the same time and successfully protects Snowden from the CIA?
1|Obama's proposal to increase taxes back to pre-Bush levels only on 250k earners would have totally balanced the budget, and as we all know higher taxes help the economy.
1|But if they abolished the Patriot Act, how would the government protect our freedoms?

1|fucking socialized medicine!
1|You mean the prosperity of unregulated capitalism dyed the waters red, white and blue for 'Merica!
1|Well in that case I guess we better start gearing up to invade North Korea, Sudan, Iran, Chad, Uzbekistan, and Zimbabwe.

0|... on it, starting up the drones !
1|That we're all poor faggots
1|Makes perfect sense, just like all the heterosexual people who do the very same thing all the time.
1|I say we just get rid of everyone currently over the age of 75 and keep all their money in SS.
1|Because Alex Jones and Glen Back are sooooo much more reliable
0|This made me laugh way too much, the Mountie actually apologized for taking it even though I was in the wrong.
1|I totally forgot that the right were the ones that pushed for worker's rights.
1|Right, because people are committing suicide at the thousands of ranges all over the country all the time
1|Yes, the effective corporate tax rate is far too high!
0|It's a huge base for him and would disrupt his ability to play any sort of moral authority card.
1|That explains the $3.5 billion that lobbyists spend buying legislation every year.
